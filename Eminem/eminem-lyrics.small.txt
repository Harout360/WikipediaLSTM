Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha"
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her
At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show
I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha"
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"

Eminem
Hello?
What Up?
Hello?
Yo I Can-I Can't hear you
let me call you right back
Verse
I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones, I might die soon
the F.B.I. might be tryin to pull my files soon
I might be walking, blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
right outside of the window, of my living room
and if they do 
then you can say goodnight and bye bye to them iTunes
if I don't try to, record as much before I do
the plan is to have as many in the can as I can
as I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
blank stare, dead pan
look on my face is a gaze into space
as I wait to be scooped up in that van
just mysteriously disappear into thin air
and they gon say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
and I go down into history
as the blood suckin leech
who hid behind the freedom of speech
tried to take the fifth ammendment
use it, twist it and bend it
and ended up dying a villain out the hero's splinters
the bendest way to end this
I can feel the trim its tremendous
in remembrance of September 11th
flashback to September 7th
when Tupac was murdered in Vegas
he said that he predicted his own death
let us never forget it
should we ever live to regret it
like the day that John F. Kennedy was assasinated
in broud day by that crazed lunatic with a gun
who just happened to work in the same block
in the library book depository where 
the president would go for a little friday stroll
shots fired from the Grassy knoll
but they don't know
but do they?
who's they for em to say?
tushay, we're all gonna revolve in a spook-ay
this is as bout as cook-ay as I've ever felt now
countdown a nuclear meltdown
7,6,5,4 3,2,1
you can run
you can do what you want to
but you you know you aint gonna do nothing
when its time, its your time
you are the prime target
you have become
Public enemy number one
Yo yo
Mic check
Testing one, two
Ffff-fuck
So if I hurt your self-esteem
And you get dissed too badyo why you diss me?
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you hada big dick
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!"
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!"nurse! nurse
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
What a wonderful dayI should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee! (oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway (what? ) and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with aids
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (mooooo!)
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed cage with +agent orange+
And wiped my ass with his page in source (here!)
The demon is here, steamin this year
I rip*mystikal's*voicebox out, scream in his ear (ahhhhhh!)
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
Give a fuck? i don't know what a fuck is to give it
"Yeah I don't think this guy is well " I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll fuckin, I'll fuckin
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nut sack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Christopher
Reeves, I was teething with strap throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm filler than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
And walkin through south central LA, bleedin in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crypt? ) wakin up the next day in breathin machines
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke
My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
Who ain't have shit to do with it, like cool j does (my tattoo!)
You see me standin outside of your buildinscreamin
"Puffy is good, (hey!) but Slim Shady is for the children!" (wait!)
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two micsI write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-heartedcause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin to get my porno career started
Every place and event +been there, done that+
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
"Come on, let's go!"
Want a deal? study these 5 chapters
Lesson one throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two face em and diss em (whattup dog? )
Don't give em a demokidnap em (I want you to come with me)
And make em come to your basement and listen
(You're gonna fuckin check this out)
Lesson three get a job at a labelswitch demos with canibus
And put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson four 'know you heard this before'
"Hey let me get your numberI'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the whitest aandr you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five get a hook-up at jive
Dress up like ICP. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the streetI ain't
Givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin
Cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like Master
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones (oww!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah ("it's all about me ")
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea ("you're a dick!")
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
Cause brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin Aaliyah
(What? oh my god!) I splish splash while I'm takin a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash -- fuckin your wife in the ass ("oh! ooh shady! oooh!")
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
So if I hurt your self-esteem
And you get dissed too badyo why you diss me?
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you hada big dick
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!"
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!"nurse! nurse
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
I know that makes you real mad, don't it?
That's right, slim shady (yup) sway and tech
Sprayin wreck (bitch)
And we don't give a heck (uh-uh)
Or a damn or a fuck or a shit
So suck my motherfuckin dick
Yeah, whattup Detroit? Nu uh, nu uh, nuh, no, he didn't
Ahh! they didn't do it again
What what, what-what?
Did you shit on these niggaz two times Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo sho! Uh uh, naw, ya smell that?
This is special right here, what what, what what what?
Yeah, its a toast to the boogie baby, uhh, to the boogie oogie oogie
Yeah, yknow! What's crackin' Dre?
Just let me lay back and kick some mo simplistic pimp shit
On slims shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on guilty conscience at concerts
And watch moshpits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when its packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and snoop draw  is niggaz from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggaz again
These grown ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me?
D R E and shady, with Doggy from Long Beach
Came a long way, to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz, and I carry it all day
Sometimes its like a nightmare, just bein' Andre
But I
Somehow, someway, tell 'em, nigga, you know about Dogg-ay
Now let me cut these niggaz up and show em where da fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin' son
Hit and run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns, and I love all of em the same bang, bang!
Damn, baby girl, whats your name?
I forgot  what'd you say it was? Damn a nigga buzzed
Hangin' in the club, with my nephew Eminem whattup 'cuz?
The great white American hope, done hooked up
With the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, bay bay!
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
I'm the head nigga in charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with god
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
Its like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the body bag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with puff
Bitch, please you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, c'mon
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
Aw naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up, in the, heezy bay bay
He's sha-day, he's so cra-zay!
Hahaha! gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the inter scope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal, makin' a living
Off of the worlds misery, what in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down, theres a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
Its just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you fagot, you happy now? Look here
I start some trouble everywhere that I go
(That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know
('Cause they know)
I start some shit they throw me out the back do
(The back do)
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo fo
(A fo fo)
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg
X to the Z, Nate Dogg
C'mon, yeah!
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
Bitch it's too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains
I'm an instigator, 380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, forgive me
I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin' I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon' fight
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?)
Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
(Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom
Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin' nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets,ascap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag
We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a luni
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin' run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin'  'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Suck my motherfuckin dick, D-12 dirty motherfuckin' dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre kid, swifty McVeigh, The Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady
[Tonya]

[Intro]
(Ca$his)
REMIX!
(Eminem)

Sly what the fuck a slick sick son of a bitch
Silly little rabbit don't you know `Trix` are for kids
This is what the moral to the story is
(Ca$his)Re-Up!
[Verse 1 - Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy who cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah*
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *ERR!* and I'm just like (Oh Yeah!)
[Chorus - Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)
[Verse 2 - Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on their shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Tharr boi don't curr'
[Chorus - Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)
[Verse 3 - Ca$his]
CA$HIS!!
Watch Jimmy get cracked to the floor wit a round
Spun around and hit the ground
You the new James Brown
New king of Mo-Town
Side wit folk while
You not a G you a joke and thay all know now
I don't brag about the way that I lived in the past
I just pray I get away after whoppin` your ass
From now on don't speak namin` your reps
I'll hop out yo` pussys' restin` on blech
But I told you Ca$his consecutively sweet life off the beat all you hear is me
I'm A B.B.G plus a B.G.D Bring it on anytime you wanna come see me
Stay alive lil` guy you don't want it with me
And your man Fifty put your money on me
King Mathers made me to blow up
Re-Up I'll crush that you know Cash up Shady!
[Chorus - Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)

Yo,
If I could start from scratch, I'd change most of it,
If  u gave me your trust, I wouldn't of broken it,
I shoulda helped you out, back in 97',
Shit I wouldn't of let u go I woulda made your life heaven
I woulda hushed my mouth, gave my shit up, 
I woulda minded my own business, n not let things get fucked,
Up, I woulda gone to church, maybe become a saint,
Erased this so-called picture we paint, 
I woulda bin a soldier, no matter what shit
I woulda bin perfect, the man u want-ed
I never woulda slacked, now this is a fact
I never woulda rhymed, ova this track
If u didn't want it, I never woulda rapped,
But this is my life n we can't change that
I woulda bin there, I never woulda tried
I would never want to live, I never woulda lied
I woulda changed it all back, to the past you see,
I never woulda let you put your fingers on me
I woulda let you be, keep my hands off the gun,
I never woulda changed, never try for number 1
I would never of intervened, just you n your son,
N now I'm revelating, putting it all into a song
I would never of invited you to any show I did,
I wouldn't of wanted you to show, even though you did
I would never shed a tear for a girl I can't stand, 
I never woulda back-talked, never raised a hand
I would never want you to think, that this shit was planned,
I woulda let you go, but I didn't think you'd understand
That we could never be together, I could never be your man,
But if I could turn back time I wouldn't put you through this again
I never woulda thought, that we could be buddies,
I never woulda asked for any pennies of your money
But its just the way you were, you were so cunning,
That's why I couldn't be your man, n you couldn't be my honey
Now I gotta start from scratch, change my whole past,
I'd change it all, make sure I never asked,
You out on a date 'cause if I knew it would never last
I woulda forgotten all about you n erased you from the cast
I don't make shit up, I speak truth if I'm rapping
But if I could go back in time, 'us' never woulda happened
(Chorus) x2 
baby im sorry
it all ended in a hurry
I didn't wanna cause no worries
but now i gotta leave..
(Konman)
Yo yo ayo
I'm fed up wid bein rejected
Detected, by your radar
You heard me and you ejected the tape
No theres no escape
I can't believe there's no-one here to see my true self, all they remember of me is rape
I try, I fail, I sigh I lie in my bedroom waitin for another world, I sleep, I die
In a dream waitin for you to come and sweep me away
It'll never come, its like I'm dreamin on hennesay.
I'm waitin for the girl that likes me for who I am
And looks past the shit in my life full barrier like a dam
This ain't no piss take
Words be spillin like a lake
And I wouldn't give to shits if u diss this like I'm a fake
I'm waitin for my eyes to awake, 'cause I've just excepted this reality
And there is a reason why a lot of people are still mad at me
From year 5, year, 6 it ended at year 7
My trouble years, this is true like the destruction of 9/11
I went down the wrong path girl but I promise
If u take me in now, I wont make a mistake 
Or be a misogynist.
(Chorus) x2
[Chorus]
Oh, all around the World,
theres an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
[Royce]
Classical palms
battle my own demons
I need a glass of Patron
bad as I need a horn
stabbing my clavicle bone
Im at it or prone
first time I seen a dessert eagle
I was letting the 44 buss
the 44 pop
first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
looking at Robocop
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain
in order to clean my things you need saline
Im never refering to the solution
I'm talking about more like the mustang
vroom
get respect from the get-go, hello
set to the echo, pyscho
pen got a mind of its own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
as the echo follows the Maserati
as the petrol swallows,
Im a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep,
right now I'm living a dream
though we may be reckless
the ladies check us
they whisper Shady records
baby echo
[Chorus]
Oh, all around the World,
theres an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
[Eminem]
I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling
I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
the only f-cking thing that you consume is time
Im super human, my world is like a Rubiks cube
its too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
my mentality's caveman stupid woman
my life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning yo
oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful
diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair folicle and cuticle
rhyming to the call, to the (?) all the way down to my sock and the hair on my toe
learn how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
cause I aint took no sh-t since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire
and this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
cause this time muthaf-ckers I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her
I aint even put my tip in that hoe yet
Ima go get TIP and try to rip it wider
[Chorus]
Oh, all around the World,
theres an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphillis germs
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
(Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it
Chorus: Eminem
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
[Eminem]
I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of thai weed
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
on if I keep on killin my girlfriends
Chorus: Eminem
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- listen!!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
[Eminem]
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS!" Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn 
Chorus: Eminem
[Eminem]
listen Hi! somethings not right
I'm sorry I'm mentaly retarted
Slim Shady I think thats my name
Rawkus Records Fuckin' Crazy
Do You hear us we're Fuckin' Crazy
All of us Hi! Bye! 9 somethin
Still on? 
Yo, is the mic on? 
Check, check, check 
Alright, let's do it 
Let's go, come on 
(Eminem, Eminem, Eminem)
My Words Are Weapons Lyrics
[Chorus x 2]
My words are weapons 
(I use em to crush my opponents) 
My words are weapons 
(Never show no emotion) 
My words are weapons 
(I use em to kill whoever steppin to me) 
My words are like weaponry on a record 
[Eminem]
The rage I release on a page is like a demon unleashed in a cage 
Lunatic, Soon as I hit the stage 
My mind is like a fuckin stick of dynamite 
Once I get behind tha mic its like the wick is lit you bitches die tonight 
My nine is like a guiding light at night shinin' bright 
My fuckin grip is tighter then my wife's vagina SIKE 
These cocksuckin **cops** 
Got my Smith and Wesson 
I guess its time to pick a different weapon man that shits depressin 
But Swift is gettin me a new one for a Christmas present 
[Swift] - Come on Slim lets go teach this fuckin bitch a lesson
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish 
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage 
Shady stay creative baby hold your head up don't u let up 
One bit on these motherfuckin suckers you a soldier get up 
Stand up for what you believe in as long as u breathin 
They jealous of you man that's the only reason they beefin' 
[Chorus x 2]
[Swift]
Its that Dirty Dozen renegade 
You done pulled the pin on my grenade 
38's will move your shit up out the way 
You niggas wont forget about McVay 
You got sumtin to say let it out today 
And watch these bullets spray 
From these ten black fingers huggin these deadly millimeters 
That will make Jeff Dahmers look like he caught a misdemeanor 
See I'm dirty so I ain't gotta to buy pistol cleaner 
An official beater don't let me see you with your heater 
You get swift with it 
Tell that mutherfucker Swift did it 
You packing sumtin special in your crib then bitch get it 
I'm physically fitted to run your digits 
I'm hostile with this **Rosco** pointed up your nostrils 
You get splitted and guess what I'm blowin up the hospital 
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a ho 
I'm hannibal lector the spinal cord disconnector findin whores 
to lockup in motels and inject em 
[Chorus x 2]
[Bizarre]
I'm eating crews like I'm Hannibal 
There's no way I could be the gay rapper 
(Em - Why Not?) 
I only fuck animals 
Stupid Trick got my dick starting to itch 
Went to my mothers grave site and called her a stupid bitch 
One on one in this blood sport 
I'm in divorce court 
Suin' my bitch off a pack of Newports 
6 times I've been arrested 
How would you feel if you let your ho witness that always got molested 
I'm smokin dank drinkin drink 
I cant have any kids 'cause I'm fuckin shooting blanks 
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck 
Nicole's a whore and I'm glad O.J murdered his slut 
Responsibility I'm negligent 
Bill Clintons a fag should be stabbed 
Let Richard Simmons be the president 
Call me a weirdo 
Call me bazeer 
While I stick up your ass till while you shit diarrhea 
Intro:
It's alright, it's ok, I'm gonna make it anyway
I'm a make it, I'm a make it, I'm a make it...somehow
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might 
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write 
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life 
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics 
And show these people what my level of skill's like 
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life 
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights 
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like 
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault 
Great big eye balls, my insides crawl 
and I clam up I just slam shut 
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's 
just been stripped, I've just been ripped 
So I must then get, hope the bus didn't split 
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home 
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road 
[Chorus] 
I'm a man, Gotta make a new plan 
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land 
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands 
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back 
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin 
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel the alone 
Ain't gonna follow no footsteps, I'm makin my own 
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road 
[Eminem] 
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back 
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap 
To the same plant, in the same pants 
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP 
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man 
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand 
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad 
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand 
While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad 
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head 
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had 
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad! 
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet 
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet 
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep 
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best 
And I try, sit alone and I cry 
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by 
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God 
Please don't let me be piegon holed in no regular job 
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are 
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow 
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye 
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far 
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know 
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow 
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own 
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road 
[Chorus] 
[Eminem] 
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it 
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is 
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits 
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate 
of authenticity, you'd never even see 
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility 
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC 
who's incredible, up on the same pedestal as me 
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time 
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes 
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline 
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go 
Who must I show, to bust my flow 
Where must I go, who must I know 
Or am I just another crab in the bucket 
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it 
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit 
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with 
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit 
at Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit 
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road 
Plus I feel like I'm old, stuck in this battlin mode 
My defenses are so up, and one thing I don't want 
is pity from no one, the city is no fun 
There is no sun, and it's so dark 
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart 
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends 
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin 
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not 
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top 
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot 
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got 
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn 
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned 
Ain't no fallin on next time I meet a new girl 
I can no longer play stupid or be immature 
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage 
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words 
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge 
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured 
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third 
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird 
Then I turn and cross over the median curb 
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road 
[Chorus]
Just pull the plug! 
People say that I'm a black juice
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
(Repeat all 2x)
[Eminem]
Hand me an.8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here
And shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than I'll
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill {ahhh
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin' feel me cuz I'ma still be
The mad rapper whether I got money or not {yup
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a No Limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself
Just pull the plug! 
People say that I'm a black juice
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
Just let it go! 
(Repeat all 2X)
[Eminem]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Rosco beating James Tar Senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps (ahhhh)
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now
Just let it go
People say that I'm a black juice
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
Just pull the plug! 
(Repeat all 2X)
[Eminem]
My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go untill your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
To sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "Role Model," I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe Kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I know that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And Just the Two of Us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch
Just let it go
People say that I'm a black juice
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
Just pull the plug! 
(Repeat all 2X)
Just do it.
Detroit, Motown
Hey guess what, they gave us two bonuses this year
And you know what happened?
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Hennied up, ginnied up, ski mask, black truck
Dickey outfit, passenger side, pistol grip pump
Fuck it I just did two lines
A chrome tech nine, it'll tear out niggaz spines
It's a party, go on in and have fun
'Cause after it's over all you gon' hear is
Shootin', blastin', hittin' the floor
Ten-thousand in the safe, shit I'm 'bout to score
'Cause I'm dangerous, off Angeldust
Shit I'll bust even the nigga that came with us
And this is for my nigga's that be robbin' and stealin'
Carjackin', murder one's, and fuckin' drug dealin'
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
I stumble in the club blowed up, nine millimeter cocked
Something's telling me to stop, fuck it I don't see the cops
Nigga's don't believe until they see it's out
Stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
Beggin' me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that naked
Come out of them diamonds and you come out of that velor
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back up shit I can use it
I need the noise in case I have to let a couple off
Saw another icey chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that butter soft, and since you buyin' out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow
I'm out for the paper, my homie better hide the jewels
I'm in the game starvin', and I ain't playin' buy the rules nigga
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Sh-sh-Shady
Life by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wanders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on while I'm on the John
If I had a million bucks it wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM
Tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks it wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit telling me to be positive
How am I supposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'? I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my word
Yea...(laughter)...whoooo...shit (a'ight) hmmm, whoaaa, hmm ...eeee
Guess what? eweee,
(I'm not coming in yet) dodoodo, (I'm coming in) in a minute
(Hey yo), ummmm, (a'ight), (this is my love song), (Hey Yo),
hey yeaaa, (aight), (It goes like this...), (a'ight)
Back when Mark Wallberg was marky mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to...mix in with bacardi dark
and when it... kicks in you can hardly talk
and by the... sixth gin you gon probly crawl
and you'll be... sick then and you'll probly barf
and my pre-...diction is that you gon probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and every-... things spinnin your beginning to think women are swimmin in 
pink linen and in the sink
then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wildin
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
get in the car and start it and start drivin
over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot, looking for life on this planet sir, 
no sign of it all i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and I'm
so high that I might die if i go by it. 
Let me out of this place I'm outta place, I'm in in outter space, 
I've just vanished without a trace. I'm going to a pretty place
now where the flowers grow, I'll be back in an hour or so. 
Hook:
Cuz every time I go to try to leave (whoa-o-o) 
Something keeps pullin on my sleeve (whoa-o-o) 
I dont wanna but I gotta stay (whoa-o-o) 
these drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa-o-o) 
Cuz everytime I try ta tell 'em no (no-o-o) 
they won't let me ever let 'em go (go-o-o) 
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (whoa-o-o) 
is drug's really gotta hold of me
In third grade all I used to do, was sniff glue
through a tube and play rubix cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game, and every face looks the same
they got no name, so i don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want, 
whenever i want, wherever I want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy has got me standin next to you
Gettin sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love wit you
But your on it too, so you tell me you love me too, 
Wake up in the morning like "What the fuck we do?" 
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do, 
Cuz if I get caught cheatin then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy, 
let that X destroy your spinal chord, so it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin like some wind-up dolls, 
shit stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur, 
Shit, six hit's won't even get me high no more, 
so bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more
Hook:
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow when you swallow it all
wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
and whats a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and whats a little fight, 
tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up? 
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin
Cuz none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin
They tell you to stop but you just sit there and yawn, even though you wake up 
feelin like shit every mornin. 
But your young, you got a lot of drugs to do, girls to screw, 
parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't, I woulda did more shit that 
people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now, and upgraded
and graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin up to do, 
I still gotta whole lot of throwin up to spew
But when it's all said and done i'll be 40
before I know it wit a 40 on the porch tellin stories
with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap, 
babysitting for Hailey, while Hailey's out gettin smashed. 
Hook 2x
Drugs really gotta hold of me
really got a hold of me
drugs really gotta hold of me
they really got a hold of me

(Chaos kid) "wow that sounds pretty poohie to me"  (M&M) "now im gonna break it down for those who dont know what a pooh butt day is"
I'm the devil if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a mind fuck, completely dis-gus-ting
I'm a human mutt, fuck a being
I'm a dog fuck lambs, I'm silencin' 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walkin', talkin', ouija board
Speakin' in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before
H-hem delle la, ennich me noughh mi niche mick norr
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
'Til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?
Well if so, get ready for some shit yo
"Is this some kind of sick joke?" Shit no, motherfuckin' schitzo
So disturbed, he just goes so berzerk he tiptoes
This verse was his urge to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with
So someone this disturbed, sa sippin' on si zzurp
So lock your doors, drop to the floors
Get your shotguns drawn here comes another "Clockwork Orange"
Look at Bizarre, you really think he's right in his mind?
What the fuck you think's goin' through it when he's writin' his rhyme?
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams
It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again
Pickin' up transvestites on my Harley Davidson
My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
And take your bottles to the store
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage I had to eat it
My dick is burnin', it ain't 'cause of disease
Because I'm jackin' off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze
I'm livin' in Waco Texas, me and my girl, fuck David Koresh
I'm startin' my own world, it's called Bizarre Cemetary, it's scary
Eatin' a virgin's cherry, they're all gonna laugh at you Carey
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams
I was born feet first, smoke forties and drink weed
The Lord rehearsed my birth, I'm the worst breed
A nigga you ever set sight on, my right arm's
Got more power than five a iontons Dragon's python so
"Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer"
Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro gas spiller
Psycho slash Michael Myers, Michael Jack's "Thriller"
Rifle slash knife faggit that's your "Cop Killer"
As a yung'un, I was beat where I was sleeping
Cross dressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed 'cause the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin' caused the cop's feelings
To be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you Bo Derek, I throw you face flat off the terrace
So you can have somethin' to stare at
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams

S-S-Shady Records, you better believe the HYPE is real...
'Yeah! Yeah! You rockin' wit the talk of New York Tony yayo Shady aftermath with the Soul Assasins.
Chorus: 
Niggas know what i'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause i don't have to
You can run your own mouth, i don't care
If you get too close i'm gon' clap you
it's too real out here, to be scared
A real nigga gon' do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
it aint considered a crim unless they catch you
We all die 1 day...
Obie Trice:
Niggas, when i step up in the bar, faggots's wanna look
Like you muthafuckas got Obie Trice shook
Like i'ma stand here as a man
and let some queer-ass funny lookin nigga get the upper hand
I got issues... got no time
Got guns than more niggas moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas rides
Everybody runnin' for they muthafuckin lives
Tough Club niggas? we leave early
Cock back shirley, open up ya fade
your gray brain needs motor city paid
Your nervous system still twitch on days; these
ho's and animals ?'s get merked
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
don't ever let a nigga tell you 'play the ball hard'
Trust in God 'cause you's about to have a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
a .45 that'll lite niggas up
and this .45 high make me not give a fuck
Chorus:
Lloyd Banks:
But as long as i'm here i'm gon' grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make ya ass bet
My words touch niggas in jail, make them wanna finish they last bet
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
if thats the case, then get a bigger one
You dont think i pack the 'bump' 'cause i'm out the hood
that's a stereotype, like everybody that's black can jump
i'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic and them
I'm out in dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish i'm established 'til the cabbage'll come
I'm in the clouds, you don't see me on a train
I travel first class, you aint ever got a TV on your plane
ssh, be easy on my name
'cause i aint goin bank n forth
your boss and ya captains's soft
Chorus:
Eminem:
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gon' get it
Man when we gon' hit 'em
chew 'em up and spit 'em out
 too much venom
and if you roll wit em
we gon' fuck you up wit 'em
i got too much momentum
movin in my direction to lose
my shoes'll explode as soon as you go to step in 'em *BOOM!*
You know how we do it when we do how we do it
and we come through, g-unit d one two (D12) and Obie we all move
like assasins, ski masks and gloves
consider this as a warning, disaster comes
faster than you can react to it, just ask Marx
we are fizzast, fuck your little bitch as up
We are not killas, my vato will have you shot though
drag the little body on fuck like kim osario's
little sorry-o ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source coovers like fuckin Cyrpress Hill
then in the Ninties when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, i don't smoke, but i toke
enough second hand to make my fuckin P.O. choke
I'm an O.G. you're fuckin wit a G.I. Joe
BIA BIA, MIA-MIA you livin la vida a loc?
i'm a psyhco, mariah aint got shit on me
when i retire i'll be spittin baby food on peep-
le it at San Ceedrow Ranch huddled up next to a em with hello kitty on slippers on humpin her 
legs
you ever had your cap peeled back? or your shit pushed in?
I'll put my blade in you like a fuckin pin cushin
slice your ear clear off, Schmirnoff and Hen dawg (hennessy)
I'll show you how to fuckin kill a man like Sin-dog
Nobody told you that i'm loco esse?

I'm Slim Sha.. DY and it is for dees nuts
and you can get each one for free so feast up
i pee in a cup for 3 months, i'm having a E party
for easter, please come

you can do all them push ups to pump up ya chest
i got a 12 gauge Marksberg to pump up ya chest
have you gaspin for air after that shell hit ya vest
fear me like you fear God 'cause i bring death
silver back gorilla in the concrete jungle
i'm the strongest around, you know how i get down
i watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
turn it off before it ends because the bad guy dies
if you tryin' to buy guns from the nigga that look to
so what they got bodies on 'em they still look new
you can raise your voice like you finna touch somethin'
when i raise my knife, shit i'm finna cut somethin
they say i walk like Ron O'neil and talk like obie (obie trice)
if the bitch think i love her, well then the bitch don't know me

Oh yeah  this is Eminem baby  back up in that motherfucking ass 
One time for your mother fucking mind  we represent the 313 
You know what I'm saying?  cause they don't know shit about this 
For the 9 6 
Verse 1: 
Ayo  my pen and paper cause a chain reaction 
To get your brain relaxin  cause they be actin maniac in action 
A brainiac in fact son  you mainly lack attraction 
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun 
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills 
I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills 
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants 
With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects 
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up 
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke 
This is the season for noise pollution contamination 
Examination of more cartoons than animation 
My lamination of narration 
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation 
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing 
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland... 
I'm Infinite 
Chorus: 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite 
Verse 2: 
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense 
I got some meat to mince some fruit to stompin and two feet to rinse 
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil loyal fans 
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal 
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people 
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium 
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one 
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator 
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus 
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases 
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces 
My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis 
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally 
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite 
Chorus: 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite 
Verse 3: 
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since 
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O 
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's 
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler 
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler 
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical 
I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school 
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical 
I'd rather led a tactful, tractical, track for your fancy 
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine 
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching 
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam 
Plus the man who never had a plan B 
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit 
I'm tense to be tempted when I see the sins my friends commit... 
I'm Infinite 
Chorus: 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite

Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oooh
Lyrics By XxWiZYxX
I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost save it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
Yeah, I can't stop now
This maybe be the last chance I get
To be famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just want to be famous
But be careful what you wish for
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed up post office worker
A Merc her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a Frankfurter
For a gangster, you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel, I faced her around
But his fangs come out, get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he out grow'd 'em
He's so out cold he's knocked out of the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigamortis and postmortem
He's dying of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
Then try to flaunt 'em
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers
You gon fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just want to be famous
But be careful what you wish for
I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to, to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whacko before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch, now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
You call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's
Got the attention of the mighty D. R. E
He's almost famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just want to be famous
But be careful what you wish for
Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screaming the wood off the panel
And cussing the paint off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these brawds
He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out ah
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie,
To hang themselves by
Like David Carradine
They can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman girl
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
And while I'm being poetic let me get a stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these winners and lords
So bare witness to some biblical shit
As a cold wind blowing this world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous
I got a riddle,
What's little and talks big,
With midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle,
That'll do anything to throw dirt on my name,
If it means walking the whole Mediterranean,
Is it an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian,
No, his name's Raymond and oh,
Oh sorry, yo, so sorry, whoa
But that was a long time ago,
When I was just Joe Schmo,
Rapping in Joe Blow's basement,
I apologized for it before so, 
Either accept it or you don't,
And let's move on,
If I ain't shown that I've grown you get the bone,*
Keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts,
Keep walking around sniffing each other's butts,
Or should I say asses,
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses,
The question I ask is how can I explain this,
How can I swing this in English language,
If I switched to slang and turned man to mane,
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain,
Am I being real or am I being fake,
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine,
Or am I caught up in this hot water,
Word on my daughter,
I told you That I love this culture,
Don't let 'em insult ya,
I'ma tell you once more again
This is the environment I was brought up in,
But every now and then,
I use my pen to get rid of some frustration,
Or should I say ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"shunÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚,
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism,*
Your face is numb, you're stunned,
Your look is cold like that of a man of 70 some years old,*
And it only gets colder,
Which is why I understand,
You can't be mad at a 44 year old fan with a chip on his shoulder,
Who only owns a half of a magazine,
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again,
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown,*
Papa can't stand me,
Papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down,
In his new chair that goes round and round,
That he bought from the money in his bank account,
That I get him every issue when the thing comes out,
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out,
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side,
Yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide,
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride,*
But ain't nobody over here buying two white guys,
Disguised as pro-black,
There is no slack for a Harvard college grat in a fitted hat,
And a hunchback standin by the clearance coat rack,
In some old slacks and some RSO throwbacks, yeah*
Shady in the place to bc,
And it takes what I got to rock the mike, right*
Still not gonna cater these punks, 
Fuckin cock-suckin, pussy-lips, hated, dicks, cunts.*
[Bob Rivers:]
Yo, yo
[Girl as Dina Rae:]
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
From Detroit to East LA
[Bob Rivers as Eminem:]
Is this a white Christmas? Hell no, my man
I'm leavin' blood in the snow and smacking fat men
You mean Santa? That boy's a bitch
He caught my mom Christmas eve and tried to give her a kiss
Fo' real, he's no joke, the guy don't play
He tried to ride way more than a one-horse sleigh
Laughing all the way, but he's not laughin' today
We'll jingle more than his bells, even the elves will pay
COME CHRISTMAS EVE, OLD NICK'S A GONNER!
We'll be snacking on deer, EATIN' Blitzen and Donner
Not a question of when, not even a maybe
Have a drunk Mrs. Clause sayin' ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"Jiggle it, Baby!ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
Give a new meaning to ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"Ho, ho, hoÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
Shake that ass, girl, bumpin' booty in the snow
So watch out Santa, you jolly old troll
We'll be strippin' that sleigh and leave you the coal
[Girl as Dina Rae:]
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a drop top Chevrolet, hey
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
From Detroit to East LA
[Bob Rivers as Eminem:]
Playing reindeer games, hell yeah my friend
Grab Rudolph's horns, and see how far they bend
When his nose turns red, his ass gets sent
Back out to the woods with his faggy elf friends
Oh, Santa Claus wouldn't list me as nice
In fact, he'll have me listed as 'naughty' twice
Not 'cause' of the fight, or the Christmas gift heist,
But Because of all the nog I left on his wife
It's time for old nick to move and retire
'Fore we roast his nuts on a big ass fire
Yes I'm that bad, Yes, I'm that crude
I mean your ass is huge, lose weight, for real dude
All the cookies and milk, simply quite sick
I mean, when's the last time you seen your dick
I don't mean to throw a fit and I'm not one to bitch
But every year I get underwear, socks, and shit
[Girl as Dina Rae:] (Bob Rivers as Eminem:)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way (check it out)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a drop top Chevrolet, hey (yeah)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
From Detroit to East LA

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingling all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a drop top Chevrolet, hey
(yo, yo)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingling all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
From Detroit to East LA
What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?
Back when Cube was rollin' wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business, but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'm a do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you
You see the truth is everybody wanna know how close
Me and Snoop is and who I'm still cool wit
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then I ain't even speakin your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth
And we can keep it the same
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big
To pay attention to 'em, that's the difference
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'
Yo I stay with it while you try to perpetrate, play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you?
About five bank accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left, yo that's the difference
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin
Aight, hold up hold up stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit
Right, Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed, who's throat is it?
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'm a sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people, then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off, drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like the Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, "I just don't give a fuck," and see who means it
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
[Intro]
Where's my penis?
I have no penis in my butt hole - there you go
Yeah.. yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have; I've been penetrated and ejaculated against
Rammin' shafts up my faggot ass, look at my brass
Ever since class I've been suckin' off my teachers to pass
All this cum motion unloadin' run deep as ocean's explodin'
Nut keeps splashin' from faggots just suck 'em off and keep goin'
Nut-takin' bummer I'm known as to every one in my region
Keep stickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' cocks in the evenin'
Leaves me with a taste as sour as seminal in my mouth
See they can bugger me, but y'all never figured me out
Look at me now; you know I got a dick in me now. 
Blame my momma?
She was the fattest slut in the house!
Chorus: 
I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm comin' out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm comin' out my closet
Ha! I got some vibrators in my closet
and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '83
before I ever had to worry about the HIV
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father used to put his willy up in my bum
cause he split, my anal cherry then he came in my eye
And lookin' back on it all now I fuckin' wish I could die
I look at gays, see, and try to picture their bare behinds
Even if I hated men , I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
to make it work with 'em, at least for papa's sake
He maybe made some mistakes
but he's the only gay who taught me everything that I know today
What he did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit he did was put a condom on his king dong
''cause he'da killed me; shit he woulda shot cum in my throat
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Batty Boy Show"
Repeat Chorus 
Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
witnessin' your momma gobblin' Mormon missionaries in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always pullin' down her drawers and clit's itchin'
Goin' through public whorehouse systems, victim of crack-controlled pimpin'
My whole life I was made to believe I was straight when I wasn't
'til I grew up, now I do what you did, I'm sick to my stomach
guzzlin' it
Wasn't it the reason you gave that VD to me MA?
So you can try but can't deny the way you treated me MA?
But guess what? You're gettin' Alzheimer's now, brain dead and alone too
And your care home security's gettin' lax, you're gonna know when I bone you
My asshole's gettin' so big now; you should see it, it's beautiful
But you'll never see it ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€" 'til I shit on you at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is when I take cocks that are long
Rips through my thong - keep tellin' myself its all 'cause'a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I fought fuckin' long and hard for these dicks
Remember when Elton came out gay and you said you're glad it's not me? 
Well guess what, I +AM+ gay - gay as a faggot can be!
Repeat Chorus (2x) till end
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors, Andre's phantom believe me clowns
That means suicide, homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world when you're the only
One with the balls and your shorts
To leave them jaws on the floor with no remorse
Remember that when they get to doggin' your boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about Bologna
I'm not gonna stop the saga
Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi, I'm moppin the floors
With them, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be, long 'til this sport is O V
E R, just blazin' and we are knockin' them doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S N double O P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yes, it's the best thing I could do right now Doodi for you is to rap
So I'mma fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'mma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate
I'mma need two mics
'Cuz the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong
I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyming bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water slaughter 'em homes
I'm on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same with you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, nah, Doodi you're not layin' on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doodi
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no
Whoo, hey, how you guys doin'?
You want more?
Alright, then shut up
Shoo bee doo

Slim shady and dre...
(Chorus 2x)
   (Kon artis)
Dont even thinka bout smackin da controls on my night with satan yo!
Okay folks, enough with the gay jokes,
Especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, aye Lok?
His style is dodo,
You've worked here longer then me, and I get paid more then you do
Dog, take a seat,
What's this guy standin' in line for?  He ain't got money to eat!
Yo, yo, this guy cashed his whole check, and bought one hoho,
Fuckin' homo, little maggot, you can't hack it
Paul's gay, you're a faggot
'Least he admits it, don't even risk it
This guy's starvin' to death, someone get him a biscuit!
I don't know what they told you, Mike
You must of had them cornrow's rolled too tight
Your job, you wanna quit but you can't
You've worked at this plant so long, you're a plant!
Look at your god damn boots,
For christ sakes they're startin' to grow roots
On this mic you be faded,
You look like a pissed off rapper who never made it
Aye why you fuckin' with the gay guy G?
When really your the one who's got the HIV
Man I'm done with this clown, that's all
Fuck it, I'll let home girl finish you off.
[Eye-Kyu:] Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Eminem:] Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know
[Chorus: Eminem]
So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Eye-Kyu:] Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 
[Chorus: Eye-Kyu]
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become
Faded voice - Fuck yeah...
Eminem: YEAHH!
LLoyd Banks: Oh shit, its the Evil Genius
Eminem: Green Lantern
LLoyd Banks: Yea... Hey yo Em, what do we call this shit right here?
Eminem: The Invasion
LLoyd Banks: You had part 1, we got part 2, now its part 3, the final chapter mother fucker
Eminem: armeggedon; lets go
I got a riddle, what's little and talks big 
with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
that'll do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walking the whole Mediterranean
is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tazmanian,
No he's name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo
So sorry wow, but that was a long time ago
When I was just Joe Shmo, rapping in Joe Blow's basement
I apologized fo' it before, so
Either accept it or you don't
And let's move on, if I aint shown that I've grown
Then get the bone, keep licking these nuts,
You industry mutts, keep walking around sniffing each other's butts
Or should I say asses?
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?
LLoyd Banks: Hold up, hold up, hold up
New York City man, its the kid LLoyd Banks
if you hearin' what I'm hearin right now, you know this ain't no regular shit homie, 
this something special and we gota bring this shit back, Green comon!
I got a riddle, what's little and talks big 
with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
that'll do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walking the whole Mediterranean
is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tazmanian,
No he's name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo
So sorry wow, but that was a long time ago
When I was just Joe Shmo, rapping in Joe Blow's basement
I apologized fo' it before, so
Either accept it or you don't
And let's move on, if I aint shown that I've grown
Then get the bone, keep licking these nuts,
You industry mutts, keep walking around sniffing each other's butts
Or should I say asses?
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?
The question I ask is..
How can I explain this?
How can I swing this, in English language?
If I switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
do I do it in vein, or simply to entertain?
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine 
Or am I caught up in this hot water
Woady on my daughter I told you I love this culture
don't let em insult ya, I'ma tell you one more 'gain
this is the environment I was brought up 'in
but every now and 'then, I use my 'pen
to get rid of some frustration, or should I say shon
this is just another one of my subliminal ways to racism
you're face is numb, you're stunned you look as cold
like that of a man who's 70 some years old
and it only gets colder, which is why I understand
it can't be mad at a forty four fan
with a chip on his shoulder
who only owns half of a magazine, and the only way to have it seen
is to put me on the front of it again
only think that makes him grin, is to see me frown
papa can't stand me, papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
in his new chair that goes round and round
that he bought from new money of his bank account
that I get him every issue when the thang comes out
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side
yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride
but aint nobody over here buying two white guys
disguised as pro-black there's no slack for a Hartford college grad.
In a fitted hat and a hunch bag, standing by the clearance coat rack
And some RSO throwbacks, yeah
Shady in the place to be seen and I got what it takes to rock the mic RIGHT
Still knockin' a K to these punks, fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips hatin' mixed cunts!
[Eminem]
Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick
**sounds of steps**
Hey yo Stick, Stick
[Sticky]
Yo Slim Shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah..
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah.. 
Well it wasn't a good.. (What was it?)
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?)
Yo, yo I dreamed I was white! (Ohhh)
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
Verse One: Sticky Fingaz
Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as Eminem's?
Blond hair, blue eyes 
The whole shibang
I know one thing
Police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me 
(Can I get your autograph?)
Yellow cabs in the cities that stop for me
I wouldn't need caladeral to buy property
If I was white
Wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob
And automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white
I wouldn't thought O.J. was innocent (He did it)
Chorus: Eminem
If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (Yo think about that)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute)
What if he was white?
What if he was (What if he was white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if 
he was white?)
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if you were white? (what if he was white?)
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white,(STICKyyyy what if you were white?) white, 
white,
white, white, white?
Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz
If I was white 
It would be a different world for me
If I was white (ummmmmmmm?)
What shade would I be?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, prepi or high class?
YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!
In any case that be L-Slim right? (Yep)
But there's a good and bad out of being white
You can't say the N word without starting a fight 
(What's UP MY BROTHER?)
True dance it'll be, I had two left feet
Even if I was white
Plaque still have a ghetto shit(How you doing?)
Is it a minfo
Or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!)
If I was white 
I would probably listen to hardcore rock
and covered my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (What if he was white?)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white 
What if he was white?
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if 
he was white?)
What if he was white?
What if he was white? 
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white(ummmmmmmm?)
What if he was white? (What if you were white?)
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if 
he was white?)
Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz
Yo,yo,yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I watched Tennis and golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
In it probably wouldn't never even been an Onyx shit
I be serice sippin vadka and tonixs
Smokin on them all on a marboral
instead of a nueport
I live in Long Island 
Instead of New York
If I was white
I probably couldn't dunk 
'cause everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the tree spots
'cause all the niggas trend think I was a cop
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? 
What - If - He - Was - White?(Yo you can't say that)
What if he was white
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? 
What if you were white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white? 
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
If he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
(What would you do if you were white?)
What - If - He - Was - White?
(What if you were white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white, 
(What if you were white!!!!)
white, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
white, white, white, white, white?
What if he was white
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
[Eminem]
Yo, what if I was White? uhh..
(dr dre)
Tell yo 'bout venger
Straight out of michigan
Slim shady
(eminem)
Venger is a big fat bitch
He's the biggest bitch I know
And he stinks like shit
Remember back then,
The days when he was skinny? 
(dr dre)
Yo.
(eminem)
Now he's fat
And he still thinks he's pretty.
He's such a slag
People who smoke grass
Are saying "shit.
Goddamn, that's a big fat ass"
Fuck that slut
He's a big fat trick
And I still won't suck
His ten foot dick
Slim shady
I'm a crazy thing
Down with dr dre
With a darkhaven swing
(dr dre)
Yo
(eminem)
I don't know much
But I know this shit
Venger is a big fat bitch
(chorus)
Venger is a big fat bitch
Venger is a big fat bitch
Venger is a big fat bitch
He's a red eyed, stink ass, horn headed bitch
(dr dre)
Uh huh
Dr dre
Check it
My homie shadow demon
Lives up the block
He's got a big fat master
Who sucks my cock
Non stop, he's a sight to see
A real evil bitch
Who does right by me
He might be the best slut
In the mountains
Ten times a week
But shit,
Who's countin'? 
I'm astounded 'bout the things he does
He used to suck in each,
Fuck in each town there ever was
He ain't a slut
He's a super groupie
And I'd pass that bitch
Around like a doobie
I don't know much
But I know this
Venger's a big fat bitch
(chorus)
(dr dre)
Oh shit
Tell 'em, em
(eminem)
I'm slim shady
That name's really cool
I might be a fuck
But I ain't no fool
(dr dre)
Uh uh
(eminem)
I just moved from darkhaven to boulder
'cause venger's trippin' on kelek's own shoulder
He's just colder 'cause I'm like that
Little freak ass pain
But you know that
(dr dre)
Yo
(eminem)
I've been followin' tracks
Like a puppy
Old horn head
Doesn't take shit from yuppies
Word up
I am slim shady
To a mother fucking t is the place to be
(dr dre)
Yo
(eminem)
I don't know much
But I know this
Venger is a big fat bitch
(chorus)
(dr dre)
Well
The dude's right
Dr dre
Eminem
Best bitch around
Fuck venger
This goes out to all the fat bitches in the realm
Yo,yo
What's up? 
Gotta drink some duff
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want them fans jumpin'
I want them fists pumpin' in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't you fill your cups?
Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much T-N-T
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Can help you to resuscitate, you bustas must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came and crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them 'cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear a skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit is getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
Da dee da dee da da dee
He makes it look so easy
Girl you just hit the lottery
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
This is where shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say, and once it's over like a seance, it hums
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smokin' something
You think I ain't smokin' nothin, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
I'm like a goose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to extract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your man's like in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm murdering the flow, liquid courage up in the blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block with your hoe
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc
Can proceed to drop me and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door
Yeah, so let us in before we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out your
Revenge is so sweet, move it 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT
Yeah, my sayings are sewers in the streets
Them haters hating on me
But I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce deuce in the seat, Dre fall off?
That's news to me
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Woah, I get your hands in the air, and get to clappin' 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is, what you thought it wasn't
It beez, the brothers representin' the dirty dozen
I be the F R O, the double G
And check out the man he goes by the name of er
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', dirty dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the puddin', just ask the Shawn Holman
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' 'Fuck the world' like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron
And blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' 'Fuck the world' like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
Somebody let me out this limousine
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against The Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jaw, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems
Got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' 'Fuck the world' like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
Hey, fuck that
Outsidaz, Pace One, Young Zee
Yo, I can't sing but I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cuz I'm happy, yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back, yo, check it out
Somedays I sit staring out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
My baby girl keeps getting' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes 'cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit, don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That Imma pistol packin' drug addict, who bags on his mama
But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled, that hurts deep inside
Of my soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should have seen it coming, what I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'?
But fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cuz my baby knows that her dad's a soldier
Nothing can take her from me
Told you I can't sing
Oh, well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said
If you ever need anything
Daddy would be right there?
Guess what? Daddy's here
And I ain't going nowhere
Baby, I love you
Yeah, you know technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
Amen
(Yeah)
Amen
(Feels good)
Amen
Amen
(Guess I'm lucky)
Amen
(Some of us don't get a second chance)
Amen
(But I ain't blowing this one)
Amen
(Nah, man)
Amen
(Shit, I feel like I can do anything now)
Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water
Commin' out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, take his hands and cuff 'em
Spin around to freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
There's a storm comin' that the weather man couldn't predict
I start the ball, prick, you better flee 'cause I get ticked
It's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm 'bout to punch ya to the ground, ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, that shit's in my trash
I be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye
So bat ya eyelashes, and keep winking and blowin' kisses
'Cause your flirting with death, I'm destroying your livelihood
I ain't just hurting your rep, I catch a flow and get goin'
No remorse, I'm showin', they slowin' for no one
Knowin' there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin' on the target like a marksman, the target is you, I shut ya lane down
Took ya spot, parked in it too, watchin' it flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can ya do?
Go get ya crew to hype ya up stand behind you like, woo
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass, and put his asses back together with glue
See you can hate 'em, he don't blame you frankly he would too
This game could I'll afford to lose him, how bout you?
Now guess who who?
Here's a clue, he came to a ball in a wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in ya ass, he's in ya ass, he's all up in ya psyche, too
Now what's his name
Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
If I had a time machine, I'm passin' ya
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Music is my time machine
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Fuck catching lightnin', he struck it, screamed shut up and thundered
Flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Rewound the future to the present, paused it don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker, he's the shit right now he's
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, send the fellow Shady, dang came
To wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same, he can't afford to be
A label in this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly, so say bye
To the O-H-I, to the new case of rock
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de grace, raise 'em high in the sky, keep 'em up
Time to bring the place alive, thanks for being patient
I will make no more mistakes, shit, my potatoes baked, homie
The veggies on my plate can fly, my filet is smoking weed
Get back if the stakes are high, shit, I ain't even suppose to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in ya face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it, Proof us here in spirit and I'm the spittin' image
I'll mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyrics?
Who? Heres a clue
He came to the ball in his wifebeater
Lost his Nike shoe, it's in ya ass, he's in ya ass
He's all up in ya psyche, too
Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
If I had a time machine, I'm passin' ya
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Music is my time machine ah
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S
Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right
To the rap mobile, let's go
(Marshall marshall)
Bitches and gentleman
It's show time
Hurry, hurry step right up
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is
(Marshall)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you
(Marshall)
You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is back
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh god, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of nine one one, so
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy Bat Syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was till everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already know who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so levy?
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg for sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre
Whuddup?
Can I get a hell yea?
Hell yea
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
So there you have it folks
Marshall
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because
Marshall
And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall
So until next time friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall
Oh hah
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?
Hi kids, do you like violence?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails
Through each one of my eyelids?
(Uh, huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
(Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
(Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
(Umm)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead"
Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted
Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard
I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut
(Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
(Oww)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians
In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
(Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Aah)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away
(Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
(Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
(Hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
(C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me, mom?
(Wah)
You ain't got no tits
(Wah)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
(Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think, that I worship the devil
That I do all types of, retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you? Good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' a Limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this
Livin' amuk, never givin' a fuck, gimme the keys I'm drunk
And I've never driven a truck but I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes, can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah fuck you too
For everytime I reminisce, yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match, "Here momma try 'em on"
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
Causin' hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes, can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah fuck you too
For everytime I reminisce, yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a click, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck, I was born during the earthquake
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes, can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah fuck you too
For everytime I reminisce, yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
Don't stop
Don't stop
[Royce Da 5' 9"]
Yeah, Bad and Evil is (BACK)
We bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
This is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
Oh once again where I fail from blundering
Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
Now I'm freefallin'
My career is gone and the weed callin'
Regardless of who's fault I was b-ballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Marshall double backed and got me from on top of the Hearse
I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
Cause I done cried Mary J Blige rivers
I realized that God's with us as soon as I decided to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
The writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z
Suddenly everybody calls
"Like I'm just checking on you dog"
While I throw up this message on the star
[Chorus]
When them bottles stop poppin'
And them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and dont stop (dont stop)
I made a promise to my momma
I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters dont stop (dont stop)
I'm living proof nigga
Its pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
Its the Worldwide American way
I'm living proof nigga
[Eminem]
Your body language is sayin' your confidence is gone
Well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on
You just gone sit there and take it or make em suck it
Tell em where to shove it straight up (?)
Fuck it,
The last time the light kicked me in the ass
I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophy it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop ass
Did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I aint poop
Shit, the day that I dont straight shoot
I'll drop out of my anti-women hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon
Got my swagga back I was dragging, hop back on it
Grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em
Without remorse man
Man of course I'm a one trick pony
Cause I'll be screaming on these horns till I'm hoarse!
[Chorus]
[Royce Da 5' 9"]
Nah I aint fading yet
I'd rather stay and rap
I mighta made a deck
I find excitement in wondering what I'ma write next
So I dont stay in debt
Me broke
You might aswell cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby
With AK's with baby bayonet's
I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying
Thats why its either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homocide Ryan
[Eminem]
Theres a bomb inside my head
I'ma live wire, I am on the edge
Teetering on it like I tore the iron mike
Get on a nut like a tyre iron
I have no desire stopping so why would I drop and roll
Thats how much I'm flying higher (?)
Rappers are fun and I'm the time cause I'm just flying by 'em
Man I'm laughing at 'em the entire time, why am I up?
Cause tribulations I have triumphed bitch I'm fired up
So it's time for me to slit your fucking lighter, light the sky up
[Chorus]
[Tony Yayo]
Yeah! You riding with the talk of New York, Tony Yayo
Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins, here we go!
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Niggaz, know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get to close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day
[Obie Trice]
Niggaz when I step up in a bar, faggots wanna loot
like you muh'fuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gon' stand here as a man and
let some queer ass, funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz vibes
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggaz we leave early cock back surely
Open up your fade your grade brain meets Motor City pave'
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay-Z
Hoes and animals skirts get murked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard
Trust in God cause youse about to get catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be with
Keep this secret {*whispers*} right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4-5 high make not give a fuck
[Chorus]
[Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty make your ass bet on words
Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish they last sents'
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
If thats the case then get a bigga one
You don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out the hood
That's a stereotype like everybody that's black and jumped
I'm in the white mink the fabric is done
Got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic, and them
Out of Dallas to the palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm in the cloud you don't see me on the trains
I travel first class you aint even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name cause I aint going back and forth
Your boss and your captain soft
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Cause we gon' bring it to anybody who want it
You want it?  You gon' get it
name 'em we gon' hit 'em chew 'em up and spit 'em out {*hoch spit*}
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
we gon' fuck you up with 'em
I got to much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step to them (Broom)
You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill
Did in the 90's when you was in diapers still
Shady Records you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough secondhand to make my fucking P.O. choke
I'm an OG, your fucking with a G.I. Joe
Bia Bia, mia mio a vida loco
I'm a pyscho Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spittin baby food on people
A tent siged on her ranch huddle up next to her
with Hello Kitty slippers on, humpin her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back or your shit pushed in
I put my blade in you like a fuckin pin cushion
slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Hen-dawg
I'll show you to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco ese?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Shay... D and the 'D' is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months
I'm having an E party for Easter please come
Cause we-
[50 Cent]
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it you want you gon' get it
You Name 'em and will hit 'em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out {*spits*}
To much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a twelve gauge Mausberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around you know how I get down
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it ends cause the bad guy die
If you tryin to buy guns from a nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on them they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fend to touch some
When I raise my knife shit I fend to cut some
See I walk like Ron O' Neil but talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me
{*laughing*}
[50 Cent] Sorry Kim
[Eminem]  Oh Sorry, Oh
[Chorus]
[Eminem]   Soul Assassins y'all, what up Muggs?
[DJ Muggs] What up Em?
[Eminem]   We outta here...
We should do something like that
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again it's the illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'til we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is hip hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Drezy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass, 50 Cent
Nah, 'em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass
The clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks
The Fif'll tell you're ass apart
A came in this game
Crush a motherfuckers from tha start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy
Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows
You're rockin' with the kid that spit sicka sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
E'eryday Dre day, front and 'cause a maylay
Turn the town upside down wit a frown upside down
I smile through sumthin' fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, go 'head, funky funk up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, it's the re-up
Shady
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
[Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back.
Say it on tape and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back.
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that.
Doubt startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black.
Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack.
But they don't know what dope is.
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this.
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest.
You picked me up, breathed new life in me. I owe my life to you.
Before the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do.
But it just dawned on me; you lost a son. See this light in you? It's dark.
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you.
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue.
'Cause me and you, we're like a crew. I was like your sidekick.
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this f-cking mic,
Or you gon' hug me. But I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do cause... 
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long 
I'm running out of time 
I need a doctor 
Call me a doctor 
I need a doctor, doctor 
To bring me back to life 
[Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle.
You come to me with ideas.
You say that these are pieces, so I'm puzzled.
'Cause the sh-t I hear is crazy,
But you're either getting lazy, or you don't believe in you no more.
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form.
Can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself,
Second guessing, and it's almost like your begging for my help. 
Like, I'm YOUR leader.
You're supposed to f-cking be MY mentor. 
I can endure no more!
I demand you remember who you are!
It was YOU, who believed in me,
When everyone was telling you, don't sign me. 
Everyone at the f-cking label, lets tell the truth. 
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you.
Nobody wanted to f-ck with the white boy...
Dre, I'm crying in this booth.
You saved my life, now maybe it's my time to save yours. 
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more.
But I ain't giving up faith, and you ain't giving up on me.
Get up Dre! I'm dying, I need you, come back for f-ck's sake
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long 
I'm running out of time 
I need a doctor 
Call me a doctor 
I need a doctor, doctor 
To bring me back to life 
[Dr Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the sh-t like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said was riding to the death
But where the f-ck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim
F-ck all you fairweather friends
All I need is him
F-cking backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the f-cking wrath of aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the f-ck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little cracker jack beat making wack math,
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I leave
And I guarantee they'll scream, Dre don't leave us like that man cause...
[Chorus]
Im about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
[Intro- talking]
{Eminem]
Shady, Aftermath
(BTOV) {nate dogg]
aye bitch, hey!
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control
hey hey Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Creek
[Bobby Creek]
I'm on the patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
