Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha"
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her
At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show
I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha"
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, "I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"

Eminem
Hello?
What Up?
Hello?
Yo I Can-I Can't hear you
let me call you right back
Verse
I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones, I might die soon
the F.B.I. might be tryin to pull my files soon
I might be walking, blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
right outside of the window, of my living room
and if they do 
then you can say goodnight and bye bye to them iTunes
if I don't try to, record as much before I do
the plan is to have as many in the can as I can
as I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
blank stare, dead pan
look on my face is a gaze into space
as I wait to be scooped up in that van
just mysteriously disappear into thin air
and they gon say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
and I go down into history
as the blood suckin leech
who hid behind the freedom of speech
tried to take the fifth ammendment
use it, twist it and bend it
and ended up dying a villain out the hero's splinters
the bendest way to end this
I can feel the trim its tremendous
in remembrance of September 11th
flashback to September 7th
when Tupac was murdered in Vegas
he said that he predicted his own death
let us never forget it
should we ever live to regret it
like the day that John F. Kennedy was assasinated
in broud day by that crazed lunatic with a gun
who just happened to work in the same block
in the library book depository where 
the president would go for a little friday stroll
shots fired from the Grassy knoll
but they don't know
but do they?
who's they for em to say?
tushay, we're all gonna revolve in a spook-ay
this is as bout as cook-ay as I've ever felt now
countdown a nuclear meltdown
7,6,5,4 3,2,1
you can run
you can do what you want to
but you you know you aint gonna do nothing
when its time, its your time
you are the prime target
you have become
Public enemy number one
Yo yo
Mic check
Testing one, two
Ffff-fuck
So if I hurt your self-esteem
And you get dissed too badyo why you diss me?
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you hada big dick
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!"
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!"nurse! nurse
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
What a wonderful dayI should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee! (oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway (what? ) and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with aids
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (mooooo!)
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed cage with +agent orange+
And wiped my ass with his page in source (here!)
The demon is here, steamin this year
I rip*mystikal's*voicebox out, scream in his ear (ahhhhhh!)
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
Give a fuck? i don't know what a fuck is to give it
"Yeah I don't think this guy is well " I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll fuckin, I'll fuckin
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nut sack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Christopher
Reeves, I was teething with strap throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm filler than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
And walkin through south central LA, bleedin in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crypt? ) wakin up the next day in breathin machines
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke
My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
Who ain't have shit to do with it, like cool j does (my tattoo!)
You see me standin outside of your buildinscreamin
"Puffy is good, (hey!) but Slim Shady is for the children!" (wait!)
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two micsI write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-heartedcause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin to get my porno career started
Every place and event +been there, done that+
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
"Come on, let's go!"
Want a deal? study these 5 chapters
Lesson one throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two face em and diss em (whattup dog? )
Don't give em a demokidnap em (I want you to come with me)
And make em come to your basement and listen
(You're gonna fuckin check this out)
Lesson three get a job at a labelswitch demos with canibus
And put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson four 'know you heard this before'
"Hey let me get your numberI'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the whitest aandr you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five get a hook-up at jive
Dress up like ICP. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the streetI ain't
Givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin
Cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like Master
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones (oww!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah ("it's all about me ")
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea ("you're a dick!")
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
Cause brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin Aaliyah
(What? oh my god!) I splish splash while I'm takin a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash -- fuckin your wife in the ass ("oh! ooh shady! oooh!")
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
So if I hurt your self-esteem
And you get dissed too badyo why you diss me?
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you hada big dick
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!"
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!"nurse! nurse
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
I know that makes you real mad, don't it?
That's right, slim shady (yup) sway and tech
Sprayin wreck (bitch)
And we don't give a heck (uh-uh)
Or a damn or a fuck or a shit
So suck my motherfuckin dick
Yeah, whattup Detroit? Nu uh, nu uh, nuh, no, he didn't
Ahh! they didn't do it again
What what, what-what?
Did you shit on these niggaz two times Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo sho! Uh uh, naw, ya smell that?
This is special right here, what what, what what what?
Yeah, its a toast to the boogie baby, uhh, to the boogie oogie oogie
Yeah, yknow! What's crackin' Dre?
Just let me lay back and kick some mo simplistic pimp shit
On slims shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on guilty conscience at concerts
And watch moshpits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when its packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and snoop draw  is niggaz from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggaz again
These grown ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me?
D R E and shady, with Doggy from Long Beach
Came a long way, to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz, and I carry it all day
Sometimes its like a nightmare, just bein' Andre
But I
Somehow, someway, tell 'em, nigga, you know about Dogg-ay
Now let me cut these niggaz up and show em where da fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin' son
Hit and run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns, and I love all of em the same bang, bang!
Damn, baby girl, whats your name?
I forgot  what'd you say it was? Damn a nigga buzzed
Hangin' in the club, with my nephew Eminem whattup 'cuz?
The great white American hope, done hooked up
With the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, bay bay!
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
I'm the head nigga in charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with god
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
Its like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the body bag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with puff
Bitch, please you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, c'mon
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
Aw naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up, in the, heezy bay bay
He's sha-day, he's so cra-zay!
Hahaha! gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the inter scope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal, makin' a living
Off of the worlds misery, what in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down, theres a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
Its just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you fagot, you happy now? Look here
I start some trouble everywhere that I go
(That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know
('Cause they know)
I start some shit they throw me out the back do
(The back do)
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo fo
(A fo fo)
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg
X to the Z, Nate Dogg
C'mon, yeah!
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
Bitch it's too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains
I'm an instigator, 380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, forgive me
I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin' I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon' fight
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?)
Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
(Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom
Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin' nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets,ascap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag
We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a luni
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin' run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin'  'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
Suck my motherfuckin dick, D-12 dirty motherfuckin' dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre kid, swifty McVeigh, The Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady
[Tonya]

[Intro]
(Ca$his)
REMIX!
(Eminem)

Sly what the fuck a slick sick son of a bitch
Silly little rabbit don't you know `Trix` are for kids
This is what the moral to the story is
(Ca$his)Re-Up!
[Verse 1 - Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy who cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah*
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *ERR!* and I'm just like (Oh Yeah!)
[Chorus - Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)
[Verse 2 - Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on their shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Tharr boi don't curr'
[Chorus - Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)
[Verse 3 - Ca$his]
CA$HIS!!
Watch Jimmy get cracked to the floor wit a round
Spun around and hit the ground
You the new James Brown
New king of Mo-Town
Side wit folk while
You not a G you a joke and thay all know now
I don't brag about the way that I lived in the past
I just pray I get away after whoppin` your ass
From now on don't speak namin` your reps
I'll hop out yo` pussys' restin` on blech
But I told you Ca$his consecutively sweet life off the beat all you hear is me
I'm A B.B.G plus a B.G.D Bring it on anytime you wanna come see me
Stay alive lil` guy you don't want it with me
And your man Fifty put your money on me
King Mathers made me to blow up
Re-Up I'll crush that you know Cash up Shady!
[Chorus - Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)

Yo,
If I could start from scratch, I'd change most of it,
If  u gave me your trust, I wouldn't of broken it,
I shoulda helped you out, back in 97',
Shit I wouldn't of let u go I woulda made your life heaven
I woulda hushed my mouth, gave my shit up, 
I woulda minded my own business, n not let things get fucked,
Up, I woulda gone to church, maybe become a saint,
Erased this so-called picture we paint, 
I woulda bin a soldier, no matter what shit
I woulda bin perfect, the man u want-ed
I never woulda slacked, now this is a fact
I never woulda rhymed, ova this track
If u didn't want it, I never woulda rapped,
But this is my life n we can't change that
I woulda bin there, I never woulda tried
I would never want to live, I never woulda lied
I woulda changed it all back, to the past you see,
I never woulda let you put your fingers on me
I woulda let you be, keep my hands off the gun,
I never woulda changed, never try for number 1
I would never of intervened, just you n your son,
N now I'm revelating, putting it all into a song
I would never of invited you to any show I did,
I wouldn't of wanted you to show, even though you did
I would never shed a tear for a girl I can't stand, 
I never woulda back-talked, never raised a hand
I would never want you to think, that this shit was planned,
I woulda let you go, but I didn't think you'd understand
That we could never be together, I could never be your man,
But if I could turn back time I wouldn't put you through this again
I never woulda thought, that we could be buddies,
I never woulda asked for any pennies of your money
But its just the way you were, you were so cunning,
That's why I couldn't be your man, n you couldn't be my honey
Now I gotta start from scratch, change my whole past,
I'd change it all, make sure I never asked,
You out on a date 'cause if I knew it would never last
I woulda forgotten all about you n erased you from the cast
I don't make shit up, I speak truth if I'm rapping
But if I could go back in time, 'us' never woulda happened
(Chorus) x2 
baby im sorry
it all ended in a hurry
I didn't wanna cause no worries
but now i gotta leave..
(Konman)
Yo yo ayo
I'm fed up wid bein rejected
Detected, by your radar
You heard me and you ejected the tape
No theres no escape
I can't believe there's no-one here to see my true self, all they remember of me is rape
I try, I fail, I sigh I lie in my bedroom waitin for another world, I sleep, I die
In a dream waitin for you to come and sweep me away
It'll never come, its like I'm dreamin on hennesay.
I'm waitin for the girl that likes me for who I am
And looks past the shit in my life full barrier like a dam
This ain't no piss take
Words be spillin like a lake
And I wouldn't give to shits if u diss this like I'm a fake
I'm waitin for my eyes to awake, 'cause I've just excepted this reality
And there is a reason why a lot of people are still mad at me
From year 5, year, 6 it ended at year 7
My trouble years, this is true like the destruction of 9/11
I went down the wrong path girl but I promise
If u take me in now, I wont make a mistake 
Or be a misogynist.
(Chorus) x2
[Chorus]
Oh, all around the World,
theres an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
[Royce]
Classical palms
battle my own demons
I need a glass of Patron
bad as I need a horn
stabbing my clavicle bone
Im at it or prone
first time I seen a dessert eagle
I was letting the 44 buss
the 44 pop
first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
looking at Robocop
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain
in order to clean my things you need saline
Im never refering to the solution
I'm talking about more like the mustang
vroom
get respect from the get-go, hello
set to the echo, pyscho
pen got a mind of its own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
as the echo follows the Maserati
as the petrol swallows,
Im a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep,
right now I'm living a dream
though we may be reckless
the ladies check us
they whisper Shady records
baby echo
[Chorus]
Oh, all around the World,
theres an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
[Eminem]
I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling
I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
the only f-cking thing that you consume is time
Im super human, my world is like a Rubiks cube
its too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
my mentality's caveman stupid woman
my life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning yo
oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful
diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair folicle and cuticle
rhyming to the call, to the (?) all the way down to my sock and the hair on my toe
learn how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
cause I aint took no sh-t since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire
and this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
cause this time muthaf-ckers I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her
I aint even put my tip in that hoe yet
Ima go get TIP and try to rip it wider
[Chorus]
Oh, all around the World,
theres an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphillis germs
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
(Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it
Chorus: Eminem
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
[Eminem]
I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of thai weed
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
on if I keep on killin my girlfriends
Chorus: Eminem
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- listen!!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
[Eminem]
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS!" Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn 
Chorus: Eminem
[Eminem]
listen Hi! somethings not right
I'm sorry I'm mentaly retarted
Slim Shady I think thats my name
Rawkus Records Fuckin' Crazy
Do You hear us we're Fuckin' Crazy
All of us Hi! Bye! 9 somethin
Still on? 
Yo, is the mic on? 
Check, check, check 
Alright, let's do it 
Let's go, come on 
(Eminem, Eminem, Eminem)
My Words Are Weapons Lyrics
[Chorus x 2]
My words are weapons 
(I use em to crush my opponents) 
My words are weapons 
(Never show no emotion) 
My words are weapons 
(I use em to kill whoever steppin to me) 
My words are like weaponry on a record 
[Eminem]
The rage I release on a page is like a demon unleashed in a cage 
Lunatic, Soon as I hit the stage 
My mind is like a fuckin stick of dynamite 
Once I get behind tha mic its like the wick is lit you bitches die tonight 
My nine is like a guiding light at night shinin' bright 
My fuckin grip is tighter then my wife's vagina SIKE 
These cocksuckin **cops** 
Got my Smith and Wesson 
I guess its time to pick a different weapon man that shits depressin 
But Swift is gettin me a new one for a Christmas present 
[Swift] - Come on Slim lets go teach this fuckin bitch a lesson
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish 
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage 
Shady stay creative baby hold your head up don't u let up 
One bit on these motherfuckin suckers you a soldier get up 
Stand up for what you believe in as long as u breathin 
They jealous of you man that's the only reason they beefin' 
[Chorus x 2]
[Swift]
Its that Dirty Dozen renegade 
You done pulled the pin on my grenade 
38's will move your shit up out the way 
You niggas wont forget about McVay 
You got sumtin to say let it out today 
And watch these bullets spray 
From these ten black fingers huggin these deadly millimeters 
That will make Jeff Dahmers look like he caught a misdemeanor 
See I'm dirty so I ain't gotta to buy pistol cleaner 
An official beater don't let me see you with your heater 
You get swift with it 
Tell that mutherfucker Swift did it 
You packing sumtin special in your crib then bitch get it 
I'm physically fitted to run your digits 
I'm hostile with this **Rosco** pointed up your nostrils 
You get splitted and guess what I'm blowin up the hospital 
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a ho 
I'm hannibal lector the spinal cord disconnector findin whores 
to lockup in motels and inject em 
[Chorus x 2]
[Bizarre]
I'm eating crews like I'm Hannibal 
There's no way I could be the gay rapper 
(Em - Why Not?) 
I only fuck animals 
Stupid Trick got my dick starting to itch 
Went to my mothers grave site and called her a stupid bitch 
One on one in this blood sport 
I'm in divorce court 
Suin' my bitch off a pack of Newports 
6 times I've been arrested 
How would you feel if you let your ho witness that always got molested 
I'm smokin dank drinkin drink 
I cant have any kids 'cause I'm fuckin shooting blanks 
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck 
Nicole's a whore and I'm glad O.J murdered his slut 
Responsibility I'm negligent 
Bill Clintons a fag should be stabbed 
Let Richard Simmons be the president 
Call me a weirdo 
Call me bazeer 
While I stick up your ass till while you shit diarrhea 
Intro:
It's alright, it's ok, I'm gonna make it anyway
I'm a make it, I'm a make it, I'm a make it...somehow
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might 
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write 
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life 
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics 
And show these people what my level of skill's like 
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life 
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights 
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like 
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault 
Great big eye balls, my insides crawl 
and I clam up I just slam shut 
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's 
just been stripped, I've just been ripped 
So I must then get, hope the bus didn't split 
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home 
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road 
[Chorus] 
I'm a man, Gotta make a new plan 
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land 
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands 
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back 
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin 
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel the alone 
Ain't gonna follow no footsteps, I'm makin my own 
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road 
[Eminem] 
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back 
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap 
To the same plant, in the same pants 
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP 
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man 
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand 
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad 
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand 
While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad 
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head 
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had 
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad! 
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet 
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet 
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep 
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best 
And I try, sit alone and I cry 
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by 
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God 
Please don't let me be piegon holed in no regular job 
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are 
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow 
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye 
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far 
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know 
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow 
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own 
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road 
[Chorus] 
[Eminem] 
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it 
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is 
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits 
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate 
of authenticity, you'd never even see 
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility 
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC 
who's incredible, up on the same pedestal as me 
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time 
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes 
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline 
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go 
Who must I show, to bust my flow 
Where must I go, who must I know 
Or am I just another crab in the bucket 
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it 
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit 
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with 
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit 
at Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit 
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road 
Plus I feel like I'm old, stuck in this battlin mode 
My defenses are so up, and one thing I don't want 
is pity from no one, the city is no fun 
There is no sun, and it's so dark 
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart 
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends 
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin 
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not 
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top 
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot 
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got 
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn 
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned 
Ain't no fallin on next time I meet a new girl 
I can no longer play stupid or be immature 
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage 
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words 
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge 
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured 
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third 
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird 
Then I turn and cross over the median curb 
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road 
[Chorus]
Just pull the plug! 
People say that I'm a black juice
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
(Repeat all 2x)
[Eminem]
Hand me an.8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here
And shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than I'll
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill {ahhh
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin' feel me cuz I'ma still be
The mad rapper whether I got money or not {yup
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a No Limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself
Just pull the plug! 
People say that I'm a black juice
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
Just let it go! 
(Repeat all 2X)
[Eminem]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Rosco beating James Tar Senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps (ahhhh)
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now
Just let it go
People say that I'm a black juice
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
Just pull the plug! 
(Repeat all 2X)
[Eminem]
My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go untill your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
To sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "Role Model," I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe Kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I know that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And Just the Two of Us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch
Just let it go
People say that I'm a black juice
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
Just pull the plug! 
(Repeat all 2X)
Just do it.
Detroit, Motown
Hey guess what, they gave us two bonuses this year
And you know what happened?
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Hennied up, ginnied up, ski mask, black truck
Dickey outfit, passenger side, pistol grip pump
Fuck it I just did two lines
A chrome tech nine, it'll tear out niggaz spines
It's a party, go on in and have fun
'Cause after it's over all you gon' hear is
Shootin', blastin', hittin' the floor
Ten-thousand in the safe, shit I'm 'bout to score
'Cause I'm dangerous, off Angeldust
Shit I'll bust even the nigga that came with us
And this is for my nigga's that be robbin' and stealin'
Carjackin', murder one's, and fuckin' drug dealin'
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
I stumble in the club blowed up, nine millimeter cocked
Something's telling me to stop, fuck it I don't see the cops
Nigga's don't believe until they see it's out
Stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
Beggin' me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that naked
Come out of them diamonds and you come out of that velor
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back up shit I can use it
I need the noise in case I have to let a couple off
Saw another icey chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that butter soft, and since you buyin' out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow
I'm out for the paper, my homie better hide the jewels
I'm in the game starvin', and I ain't playin' buy the rules nigga
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Sh-sh-Shady
Life by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wanders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on while I'm on the John
If I had a million bucks it wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM
Tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks it wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit telling me to be positive
How am I supposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'? I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my word
Yea...(laughter)...whoooo...shit (a'ight) hmmm, whoaaa, hmm ...eeee
Guess what? eweee,
(I'm not coming in yet) dodoodo, (I'm coming in) in a minute
(Hey yo), ummmm, (a'ight), (this is my love song), (Hey Yo),
hey yeaaa, (aight), (It goes like this...), (a'ight)
Back when Mark Wallberg was marky mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to...mix in with bacardi dark
and when it... kicks in you can hardly talk
and by the... sixth gin you gon probly crawl
and you'll be... sick then and you'll probly barf
and my pre-...diction is that you gon probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and every-... things spinnin your beginning to think women are swimmin in 
pink linen and in the sink
then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wildin
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
get in the car and start it and start drivin
over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot, looking for life on this planet sir, 
no sign of it all i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and I'm
so high that I might die if i go by it. 
Let me out of this place I'm outta place, I'm in in outter space, 
I've just vanished without a trace. I'm going to a pretty place
now where the flowers grow, I'll be back in an hour or so. 
Hook:
Cuz every time I go to try to leave (whoa-o-o) 
Something keeps pullin on my sleeve (whoa-o-o) 
I dont wanna but I gotta stay (whoa-o-o) 
these drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa-o-o) 
Cuz everytime I try ta tell 'em no (no-o-o) 
they won't let me ever let 'em go (go-o-o) 
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (whoa-o-o) 
is drug's really gotta hold of me
In third grade all I used to do, was sniff glue
through a tube and play rubix cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game, and every face looks the same
they got no name, so i don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want, 
whenever i want, wherever I want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy has got me standin next to you
Gettin sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love wit you
But your on it too, so you tell me you love me too, 
Wake up in the morning like "What the fuck we do?" 
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do, 
Cuz if I get caught cheatin then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy, 
let that X destroy your spinal chord, so it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin like some wind-up dolls, 
shit stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur, 
Shit, six hit's won't even get me high no more, 
so bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more
Hook:
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow when you swallow it all
wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
and whats a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and whats a little fight, 
tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up? 
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin
Cuz none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin
They tell you to stop but you just sit there and yawn, even though you wake up 
feelin like shit every mornin. 
But your young, you got a lot of drugs to do, girls to screw, 
parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't, I woulda did more shit that 
people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now, and upgraded
and graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin up to do, 
I still gotta whole lot of throwin up to spew
But when it's all said and done i'll be 40
before I know it wit a 40 on the porch tellin stories
with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap, 
babysitting for Hailey, while Hailey's out gettin smashed. 
Hook 2x
Drugs really gotta hold of me
really got a hold of me
drugs really gotta hold of me
they really got a hold of me

(Chaos kid) "wow that sounds pretty poohie to me"  (M&M) "now im gonna break it down for those who dont know what a pooh butt day is"
I'm the devil if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a mind fuck, completely dis-gus-ting
I'm a human mutt, fuck a being
I'm a dog fuck lambs, I'm silencin' 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walkin', talkin', ouija board
Speakin' in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before
H-hem delle la, ennich me noughh mi niche mick norr
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
'Til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?
Well if so, get ready for some shit yo
"Is this some kind of sick joke?" Shit no, motherfuckin' schitzo
So disturbed, he just goes so berzerk he tiptoes
This verse was his urge to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with
So someone this disturbed, sa sippin' on si zzurp
So lock your doors, drop to the floors
Get your shotguns drawn here comes another "Clockwork Orange"
Look at Bizarre, you really think he's right in his mind?
What the fuck you think's goin' through it when he's writin' his rhyme?
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams
It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again
Pickin' up transvestites on my Harley Davidson
My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
And take your bottles to the store
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage I had to eat it
My dick is burnin', it ain't 'cause of disease
Because I'm jackin' off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze
I'm livin' in Waco Texas, me and my girl, fuck David Koresh
I'm startin' my own world, it's called Bizarre Cemetary, it's scary
Eatin' a virgin's cherry, they're all gonna laugh at you Carey
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams
I was born feet first, smoke forties and drink weed
The Lord rehearsed my birth, I'm the worst breed
A nigga you ever set sight on, my right arm's
Got more power than five a iontons Dragon's python so
"Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer"
Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro gas spiller
Psycho slash Michael Myers, Michael Jack's "Thriller"
Rifle slash knife faggit that's your "Cop Killer"
As a yung'un, I was beat where I was sleeping
Cross dressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed 'cause the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin' caused the cop's feelings
To be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you Bo Derek, I throw you face flat off the terrace
So you can have somethin' to stare at
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You 'bout to journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams

S-S-Shady Records, you better believe the HYPE is real...
'Yeah! Yeah! You rockin' wit the talk of New York Tony yayo Shady aftermath with the Soul Assasins.
Chorus: 
Niggas know what i'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause i don't have to
You can run your own mouth, i don't care
If you get too close i'm gon' clap you
it's too real out here, to be scared
A real nigga gon' do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
it aint considered a crim unless they catch you
We all die 1 day...
Obie Trice:
Niggas, when i step up in the bar, faggots's wanna look
Like you muthafuckas got Obie Trice shook
Like i'ma stand here as a man
and let some queer-ass funny lookin nigga get the upper hand
I got issues... got no time
Got guns than more niggas moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas rides
Everybody runnin' for they muthafuckin lives
Tough Club niggas? we leave early
Cock back shirley, open up ya fade
your gray brain needs motor city paid
Your nervous system still twitch on days; these
ho's and animals ?'s get merked
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
don't ever let a nigga tell you 'play the ball hard'
Trust in God 'cause you's about to have a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
a .45 that'll lite niggas up
and this .45 high make me not give a fuck
Chorus:
Lloyd Banks:
But as long as i'm here i'm gon' grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make ya ass bet
My words touch niggas in jail, make them wanna finish they last bet
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
if thats the case, then get a bigger one
You dont think i pack the 'bump' 'cause i'm out the hood
that's a stereotype, like everybody that's black can jump
i'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic and them
I'm out in dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish i'm established 'til the cabbage'll come
I'm in the clouds, you don't see me on a train
I travel first class, you aint ever got a TV on your plane
ssh, be easy on my name
'cause i aint goin bank n forth
your boss and ya captains's soft
Chorus:
Eminem:
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gon' get it
Man when we gon' hit 'em
chew 'em up and spit 'em out
 too much venom
and if you roll wit em
we gon' fuck you up wit 'em
i got too much momentum
movin in my direction to lose
my shoes'll explode as soon as you go to step in 'em *BOOM!*
You know how we do it when we do how we do it
and we come through, g-unit d one two (D12) and Obie we all move
like assasins, ski masks and gloves
consider this as a warning, disaster comes
faster than you can react to it, just ask Marx
we are fizzast, fuck your little bitch as up
We are not killas, my vato will have you shot though
drag the little body on fuck like kim osario's
little sorry-o ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source coovers like fuckin Cyrpress Hill
then in the Ninties when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, i don't smoke, but i toke
enough second hand to make my fuckin P.O. choke
I'm an O.G. you're fuckin wit a G.I. Joe
BIA BIA, MIA-MIA you livin la vida a loc?
i'm a psyhco, mariah aint got shit on me
when i retire i'll be spittin baby food on peep-
le it at San Ceedrow Ranch huddled up next to a em with hello kitty on slippers on humpin her 
legs
you ever had your cap peeled back? or your shit pushed in?
I'll put my blade in you like a fuckin pin cushin
slice your ear clear off, Schmirnoff and Hen dawg (hennessy)
I'll show you how to fuckin kill a man like Sin-dog
Nobody told you that i'm loco esse?

I'm Slim Sha.. DY and it is for dees nuts
and you can get each one for free so feast up
i pee in a cup for 3 months, i'm having a E party
for easter, please come

you can do all them push ups to pump up ya chest
i got a 12 gauge Marksberg to pump up ya chest
have you gaspin for air after that shell hit ya vest
fear me like you fear God 'cause i bring death
silver back gorilla in the concrete jungle
i'm the strongest around, you know how i get down
i watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
turn it off before it ends because the bad guy dies
if you tryin' to buy guns from the nigga that look to
so what they got bodies on 'em they still look new
you can raise your voice like you finna touch somethin'
when i raise my knife, shit i'm finna cut somethin
they say i walk like Ron O'neil and talk like obie (obie trice)
if the bitch think i love her, well then the bitch don't know me

Oh yeah  this is Eminem baby  back up in that motherfucking ass 
One time for your mother fucking mind  we represent the 313 
You know what I'm saying?  cause they don't know shit about this 
For the 9 6 
Verse 1: 
Ayo  my pen and paper cause a chain reaction 
To get your brain relaxin  cause they be actin maniac in action 
A brainiac in fact son  you mainly lack attraction 
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun 
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills 
I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills 
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants 
With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects 
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up 
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke 
This is the season for noise pollution contamination 
Examination of more cartoons than animation 
My lamination of narration 
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation 
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing 
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland... 
I'm Infinite 
Chorus: 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite 
Verse 2: 
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense 
I got some meat to mince some fruit to stompin and two feet to rinse 
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil loyal fans 
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal 
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people 
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium 
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one 
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator 
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus 
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases 
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces 
My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis 
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally 
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite 
Chorus: 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite 
Verse 3: 
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since 
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O 
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's 
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler 
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler 
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical 
I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school 
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical 
I'd rather led a tactful, tractical, track for your fancy 
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine 
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching 
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam 
Plus the man who never had a plan B 
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit 
I'm tense to be tempted when I see the sins my friends commit... 
I'm Infinite 
Chorus: 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite 
You heard of hell well I was sent from it 
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments 
Now I'm trying to repent from it 
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it... 
I'm Infinite

Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oooh
Lyrics By XxWiZYxX
I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
I can almost save it
This shit makes no sense to me
What does it all mean?
I can almost taste it
Yeah, I can't stop now
This maybe be the last chance I get
To be famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just want to be famous
But be careful what you wish for
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed up post office worker
A Merc her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a Frankfurter
For a gangster, you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel, I faced her around
But his fangs come out, get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he out grow'd 'em
He's so out cold he's knocked out of the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigamortis and postmortem
He's dying of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
Then try to flaunt 'em
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers
You gon fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just want to be famous
But be careful what you wish for
I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to, to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whacko before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch, now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
You call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's
Got the attention of the mighty D. R. E
He's almost famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just want to be famous
But be careful what you wish for
Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screaming the wood off the panel
And cussing the paint off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these brawds
He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out ah
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie,
To hang themselves by
Like David Carradine
They can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman girl
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
And while I'm being poetic let me get a stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these winners and lords
So bare witness to some biblical shit
As a cold wind blowing this world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous
I got a riddle,
What's little and talks big,
With midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle,
That'll do anything to throw dirt on my name,
If it means walking the whole Mediterranean,
Is it an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian,
No, his name's Raymond and oh,
Oh sorry, yo, so sorry, whoa
But that was a long time ago,
When I was just Joe Schmo,
Rapping in Joe Blow's basement,
I apologized for it before so, 
Either accept it or you don't,
And let's move on,
If I ain't shown that I've grown you get the bone,*
Keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts,
Keep walking around sniffing each other's butts,
Or should I say asses,
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses,
The question I ask is how can I explain this,
How can I swing this in English language,
If I switched to slang and turned man to mane,
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain,
Am I being real or am I being fake,
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine,
Or am I caught up in this hot water,
Word on my daughter,
I told you That I love this culture,
Don't let 'em insult ya,
I'ma tell you once more again
This is the environment I was brought up in,
But every now and then,
I use my pen to get rid of some frustration,
Or should I say ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"shunÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚,
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism,*
Your face is numb, you're stunned,
Your look is cold like that of a man of 70 some years old,*
And it only gets colder,
Which is why I understand,
You can't be mad at a 44 year old fan with a chip on his shoulder,
Who only owns a half of a magazine,
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again,
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown,*
Papa can't stand me,
Papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down,
In his new chair that goes round and round,
That he bought from the money in his bank account,
That I get him every issue when the thing comes out,
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out,
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side,
Yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide,
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride,*
But ain't nobody over here buying two white guys,
Disguised as pro-black,
There is no slack for a Harvard college grat in a fitted hat,
And a hunchback standin by the clearance coat rack,
In some old slacks and some RSO throwbacks, yeah*
Shady in the place to bc,
And it takes what I got to rock the mike, right*
Still not gonna cater these punks, 
Fuckin cock-suckin, pussy-lips, hated, dicks, cunts.*
[Bob Rivers:]
Yo, yo
[Girl as Dina Rae:]
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
From Detroit to East LA
[Bob Rivers as Eminem:]
Is this a white Christmas? Hell no, my man
I'm leavin' blood in the snow and smacking fat men
You mean Santa? That boy's a bitch
He caught my mom Christmas eve and tried to give her a kiss
Fo' real, he's no joke, the guy don't play
He tried to ride way more than a one-horse sleigh
Laughing all the way, but he's not laughin' today
We'll jingle more than his bells, even the elves will pay
COME CHRISTMAS EVE, OLD NICK'S A GONNER!
We'll be snacking on deer, EATIN' Blitzen and Donner
Not a question of when, not even a maybe
Have a drunk Mrs. Clause sayin' ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"Jiggle it, Baby!ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
Give a new meaning to ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"Ho, ho, hoÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
Shake that ass, girl, bumpin' booty in the snow
So watch out Santa, you jolly old troll
We'll be strippin' that sleigh and leave you the coal
[Girl as Dina Rae:]
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a drop top Chevrolet, hey
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
From Detroit to East LA
[Bob Rivers as Eminem:]
Playing reindeer games, hell yeah my friend
Grab Rudolph's horns, and see how far they bend
When his nose turns red, his ass gets sent
Back out to the woods with his faggy elf friends
Oh, Santa Claus wouldn't list me as nice
In fact, he'll have me listed as 'naughty' twice
Not 'cause' of the fight, or the Christmas gift heist,
But Because of all the nog I left on his wife
It's time for old nick to move and retire
'Fore we roast his nuts on a big ass fire
Yes I'm that bad, Yes, I'm that crude
I mean your ass is huge, lose weight, for real dude
All the cookies and milk, simply quite sick
I mean, when's the last time you seen your dick
I don't mean to throw a fit and I'm not one to bitch
But every year I get underwear, socks, and shit
[Girl as Dina Rae:] (Bob Rivers as Eminem:)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way (check it out)
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a drop top Chevrolet, hey (yeah)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jinglin' all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
From Detroit to East LA

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingling all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a drop top Chevrolet, hey
(yo, yo)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingling all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
From Detroit to East LA
What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?
Back when Cube was rollin' wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business, but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'm a do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you
You see the truth is everybody wanna know how close
Me and Snoop is and who I'm still cool wit
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then I ain't even speakin your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth
And we can keep it the same
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big
To pay attention to 'em, that's the difference
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'
Yo I stay with it while you try to perpetrate, play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you?
About five bank accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left, yo that's the difference
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin
Aight, hold up hold up stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit
Right, Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed, who's throat is it?
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'm a sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people, then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off, drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like the Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, "I just don't give a fuck," and see who means it
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
[Intro]
Where's my penis?
I have no penis in my butt hole - there you go
Yeah.. yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have; I've been penetrated and ejaculated against
Rammin' shafts up my faggot ass, look at my brass
Ever since class I've been suckin' off my teachers to pass
All this cum motion unloadin' run deep as ocean's explodin'
Nut keeps splashin' from faggots just suck 'em off and keep goin'
Nut-takin' bummer I'm known as to every one in my region
Keep stickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' cocks in the evenin'
Leaves me with a taste as sour as seminal in my mouth
See they can bugger me, but y'all never figured me out
Look at me now; you know I got a dick in me now. 
Blame my momma?
She was the fattest slut in the house!
Chorus: 
I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm comin' out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm comin' out my closet
Ha! I got some vibrators in my closet
and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '83
before I ever had to worry about the HIV
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father used to put his willy up in my bum
cause he split, my anal cherry then he came in my eye
And lookin' back on it all now I fuckin' wish I could die
I look at gays, see, and try to picture their bare behinds
Even if I hated men , I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
to make it work with 'em, at least for papa's sake
He maybe made some mistakes
but he's the only gay who taught me everything that I know today
What he did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit he did was put a condom on his king dong
''cause he'da killed me; shit he woulda shot cum in my throat
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Batty Boy Show"
Repeat Chorus 
Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
witnessin' your momma gobblin' Mormon missionaries in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always pullin' down her drawers and clit's itchin'
Goin' through public whorehouse systems, victim of crack-controlled pimpin'
My whole life I was made to believe I was straight when I wasn't
'til I grew up, now I do what you did, I'm sick to my stomach
guzzlin' it
Wasn't it the reason you gave that VD to me MA?
So you can try but can't deny the way you treated me MA?
But guess what? You're gettin' Alzheimer's now, brain dead and alone too
And your care home security's gettin' lax, you're gonna know when I bone you
My asshole's gettin' so big now; you should see it, it's beautiful
But you'll never see it ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€" 'til I shit on you at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is when I take cocks that are long
Rips through my thong - keep tellin' myself its all 'cause'a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I fought fuckin' long and hard for these dicks
Remember when Elton came out gay and you said you're glad it's not me? 
Well guess what, I +AM+ gay - gay as a faggot can be!
Repeat Chorus (2x) till end
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors, Andre's phantom believe me clowns
That means suicide, homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world when you're the only
One with the balls and your shorts
To leave them jaws on the floor with no remorse
Remember that when they get to doggin' your boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about Bologna
I'm not gonna stop the saga
Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi, I'm moppin the floors
With them, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be, long 'til this sport is O V
E R, just blazin' and we are knockin' them doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S N double O P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yes, it's the best thing I could do right now Doodi for you is to rap
So I'mma fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'mma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate
I'mma need two mics
'Cuz the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong
I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyming bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water slaughter 'em homes
I'm on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same with you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, nah, Doodi you're not layin' on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doodi
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no
Whoo, hey, how you guys doin'?
You want more?
Alright, then shut up
Shoo bee doo

Slim shady and dre...
(Chorus 2x)
   (Kon artis)
Dont even thinka bout smackin da controls on my night with satan yo!
Okay folks, enough with the gay jokes,
Especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, aye Lok?
His style is dodo,
You've worked here longer then me, and I get paid more then you do
Dog, take a seat,
What's this guy standin' in line for?  He ain't got money to eat!
Yo, yo, this guy cashed his whole check, and bought one hoho,
Fuckin' homo, little maggot, you can't hack it
Paul's gay, you're a faggot
'Least he admits it, don't even risk it
This guy's starvin' to death, someone get him a biscuit!
I don't know what they told you, Mike
You must of had them cornrow's rolled too tight
Your job, you wanna quit but you can't
You've worked at this plant so long, you're a plant!
Look at your god damn boots,
For christ sakes they're startin' to grow roots
On this mic you be faded,
You look like a pissed off rapper who never made it
Aye why you fuckin' with the gay guy G?
When really your the one who's got the HIV
Man I'm done with this clown, that's all
Fuck it, I'll let home girl finish you off.
[Eye-Kyu:] Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Eminem:] Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know
[Chorus: Eminem]
So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Eye-Kyu:] Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 
[Chorus: Eye-Kyu]
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become
Faded voice - Fuck yeah...
Eminem: YEAHH!
LLoyd Banks: Oh shit, its the Evil Genius
Eminem: Green Lantern
LLoyd Banks: Yea... Hey yo Em, what do we call this shit right here?
Eminem: The Invasion
LLoyd Banks: You had part 1, we got part 2, now its part 3, the final chapter mother fucker
Eminem: armeggedon; lets go
I got a riddle, what's little and talks big 
with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
that'll do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walking the whole Mediterranean
is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tazmanian,
No he's name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo
So sorry wow, but that was a long time ago
When I was just Joe Shmo, rapping in Joe Blow's basement
I apologized fo' it before, so
Either accept it or you don't
And let's move on, if I aint shown that I've grown
Then get the bone, keep licking these nuts,
You industry mutts, keep walking around sniffing each other's butts
Or should I say asses?
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?
LLoyd Banks: Hold up, hold up, hold up
New York City man, its the kid LLoyd Banks
if you hearin' what I'm hearin right now, you know this ain't no regular shit homie, 
this something special and we gota bring this shit back, Green comon!
I got a riddle, what's little and talks big 
with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
that'll do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walking the whole Mediterranean
is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tazmanian,
No he's name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo
So sorry wow, but that was a long time ago
When I was just Joe Shmo, rapping in Joe Blow's basement
I apologized fo' it before, so
Either accept it or you don't
And let's move on, if I aint shown that I've grown
Then get the bone, keep licking these nuts,
You industry mutts, keep walking around sniffing each other's butts
Or should I say asses?
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?
The question I ask is..
How can I explain this?
How can I swing this, in English language?
If I switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
do I do it in vein, or simply to entertain?
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine 
Or am I caught up in this hot water
Woady on my daughter I told you I love this culture
don't let em insult ya, I'ma tell you one more 'gain
this is the environment I was brought up 'in
but every now and 'then, I use my 'pen
to get rid of some frustration, or should I say shon
this is just another one of my subliminal ways to racism
you're face is numb, you're stunned you look as cold
like that of a man who's 70 some years old
and it only gets colder, which is why I understand
it can't be mad at a forty four fan
with a chip on his shoulder
who only owns half of a magazine, and the only way to have it seen
is to put me on the front of it again
only think that makes him grin, is to see me frown
papa can't stand me, papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
in his new chair that goes round and round
that he bought from new money of his bank account
that I get him every issue when the thang comes out
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side
yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride
but aint nobody over here buying two white guys
disguised as pro-black there's no slack for a Hartford college grad.
In a fitted hat and a hunch bag, standing by the clearance coat rack
And some RSO throwbacks, yeah
Shady in the place to be seen and I got what it takes to rock the mic RIGHT
Still knockin' a K to these punks, fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips hatin' mixed cunts!
[Eminem]
Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick
**sounds of steps**
Hey yo Stick, Stick
[Sticky]
Yo Slim Shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah..
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah.. 
Well it wasn't a good.. (What was it?)
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?)
Yo, yo I dreamed I was white! (Ohhh)
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
Verse One: Sticky Fingaz
Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as Eminem's?
Blond hair, blue eyes 
The whole shibang
I know one thing
Police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me 
(Can I get your autograph?)
Yellow cabs in the cities that stop for me
I wouldn't need caladeral to buy property
If I was white
Wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob
And automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white
I wouldn't thought O.J. was innocent (He did it)
Chorus: Eminem
If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (Yo think about that)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute)
What if he was white?
What if he was (What if he was white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if 
he was white?)
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if you were white? (what if he was white?)
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white,(STICKyyyy what if you were white?) white, 
white,
white, white, white?
Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz
If I was white 
It would be a different world for me
If I was white (ummmmmmmm?)
What shade would I be?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, prepi or high class?
YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!
In any case that be L-Slim right? (Yep)
But there's a good and bad out of being white
You can't say the N word without starting a fight 
(What's UP MY BROTHER?)
True dance it'll be, I had two left feet
Even if I was white
Plaque still have a ghetto shit(How you doing?)
Is it a minfo
Or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!)
If I was white 
I would probably listen to hardcore rock
and covered my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (What if he was white?)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white 
What if he was white?
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if 
he was white?)
What if he was white?
What if he was white? 
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white(ummmmmmmm?)
What if he was white? (What if you were white?)
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if 
he was white?)
Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz
Yo,yo,yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I watched Tennis and golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
In it probably wouldn't never even been an Onyx shit
I be serice sippin vadka and tonixs
Smokin on them all on a marboral
instead of a nueport
I live in Long Island 
Instead of New York
If I was white
I probably couldn't dunk 
'cause everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the tree spots
'cause all the niggas trend think I was a cop
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? 
What - If - He - Was - White?(Yo you can't say that)
What if he was white
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? 
What if you were white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white? 
What if he was 
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
If he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
(What would you do if you were white?)
What - If - He - Was - White?
(What if you were white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white, 
(What if you were white!!!!)
white, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
white, white, white, white, white?
What if he was white
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
[Eminem]
Yo, what if I was White? uhh..
(dr dre)
Tell yo 'bout venger
Straight out of michigan
Slim shady
(eminem)
Venger is a big fat bitch
He's the biggest bitch I know
And he stinks like shit
Remember back then,
The days when he was skinny? 
(dr dre)
Yo.
(eminem)
Now he's fat
And he still thinks he's pretty.
He's such a slag
People who smoke grass
Are saying "shit.
Goddamn, that's a big fat ass"
Fuck that slut
He's a big fat trick
And I still won't suck
His ten foot dick
Slim shady
I'm a crazy thing
Down with dr dre
With a darkhaven swing
(dr dre)
Yo
(eminem)
I don't know much
But I know this shit
Venger is a big fat bitch
(chorus)
Venger is a big fat bitch
Venger is a big fat bitch
Venger is a big fat bitch
He's a red eyed, stink ass, horn headed bitch
(dr dre)
Uh huh
Dr dre
Check it
My homie shadow demon
Lives up the block
He's got a big fat master
Who sucks my cock
Non stop, he's a sight to see
A real evil bitch
Who does right by me
He might be the best slut
In the mountains
Ten times a week
But shit,
Who's countin'? 
I'm astounded 'bout the things he does
He used to suck in each,
Fuck in each town there ever was
He ain't a slut
He's a super groupie
And I'd pass that bitch
Around like a doobie
I don't know much
But I know this
Venger's a big fat bitch
(chorus)
(dr dre)
Oh shit
Tell 'em, em
(eminem)
I'm slim shady
That name's really cool
I might be a fuck
But I ain't no fool
(dr dre)
Uh uh
(eminem)
I just moved from darkhaven to boulder
'cause venger's trippin' on kelek's own shoulder
He's just colder 'cause I'm like that
Little freak ass pain
But you know that
(dr dre)
Yo
(eminem)
I've been followin' tracks
Like a puppy
Old horn head
Doesn't take shit from yuppies
Word up
I am slim shady
To a mother fucking t is the place to be
(dr dre)
Yo
(eminem)
I don't know much
But I know this
Venger is a big fat bitch
(chorus)
(dr dre)
Well
The dude's right
Dr dre
Eminem
Best bitch around
Fuck venger
This goes out to all the fat bitches in the realm
Yo,yo
What's up? 
Gotta drink some duff
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want them fans jumpin'
I want them fists pumpin' in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't you fill your cups?
Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much T-N-T
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Can help you to resuscitate, you bustas must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came and crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them 'cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear a skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit is getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
Da dee da dee da da dee
He makes it look so easy
Girl you just hit the lottery
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
This is where shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say, and once it's over like a seance, it hums
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smokin' something
You think I ain't smokin' nothin, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
I'm like a goose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to extract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your man's like in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm murdering the flow, liquid courage up in the blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block with your hoe
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc
Can proceed to drop me and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door
Yeah, so let us in before we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out your
Revenge is so sweet, move it 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT
Yeah, my sayings are sewers in the streets
Them haters hating on me
But I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce deuce in the seat, Dre fall off?
That's news to me
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Woah, I get your hands in the air, and get to clappin' 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is, what you thought it wasn't
It beez, the brothers representin' the dirty dozen
I be the F R O, the double G
And check out the man he goes by the name of er
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', dirty dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the puddin', just ask the Shawn Holman
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' 'Fuck the world' like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron
And blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' 'Fuck the world' like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
Somebody let me out this limousine
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against The Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jaw, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems
Got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' 'Fuck the world' like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
Hey, fuck that
Outsidaz, Pace One, Young Zee
Yo, I can't sing but I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cuz I'm happy, yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back, yo, check it out
Somedays I sit staring out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
My baby girl keeps getting' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes 'cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit, don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That Imma pistol packin' drug addict, who bags on his mama
But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled, that hurts deep inside
Of my soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should have seen it coming, what I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'?
But fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cuz my baby knows that her dad's a soldier
Nothing can take her from me
Told you I can't sing
Oh, well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said
If you ever need anything
Daddy would be right there?
Guess what? Daddy's here
And I ain't going nowhere
Baby, I love you
Yeah, you know technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
Amen
(Yeah)
Amen
(Feels good)
Amen
Amen
(Guess I'm lucky)
Amen
(Some of us don't get a second chance)
Amen
(But I ain't blowing this one)
Amen
(Nah, man)
Amen
(Shit, I feel like I can do anything now)
Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water
Commin' out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, take his hands and cuff 'em
Spin around to freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
There's a storm comin' that the weather man couldn't predict
I start the ball, prick, you better flee 'cause I get ticked
It's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm 'bout to punch ya to the ground, ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, that shit's in my trash
I be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye
So bat ya eyelashes, and keep winking and blowin' kisses
'Cause your flirting with death, I'm destroying your livelihood
I ain't just hurting your rep, I catch a flow and get goin'
No remorse, I'm showin', they slowin' for no one
Knowin' there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin' on the target like a marksman, the target is you, I shut ya lane down
Took ya spot, parked in it too, watchin' it flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can ya do?
Go get ya crew to hype ya up stand behind you like, woo
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass, and put his asses back together with glue
See you can hate 'em, he don't blame you frankly he would too
This game could I'll afford to lose him, how bout you?
Now guess who who?
Here's a clue, he came to a ball in a wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in ya ass, he's in ya ass, he's all up in ya psyche, too
Now what's his name
Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
If I had a time machine, I'm passin' ya
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Music is my time machine
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Fuck catching lightnin', he struck it, screamed shut up and thundered
Flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Rewound the future to the present, paused it don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker, he's the shit right now he's
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, send the fellow Shady, dang came
To wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same, he can't afford to be
A label in this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly, so say bye
To the O-H-I, to the new case of rock
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de grace, raise 'em high in the sky, keep 'em up
Time to bring the place alive, thanks for being patient
I will make no more mistakes, shit, my potatoes baked, homie
The veggies on my plate can fly, my filet is smoking weed
Get back if the stakes are high, shit, I ain't even suppose to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in ya face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it, Proof us here in spirit and I'm the spittin' image
I'll mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyrics?
Who? Heres a clue
He came to the ball in his wifebeater
Lost his Nike shoe, it's in ya ass, he's in ya ass
He's all up in ya psyche, too
Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
If I had a time machine, I'm passin' ya
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Music is my time machine ah
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S
Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right
To the rap mobile, let's go
(Marshall marshall)
Bitches and gentleman
It's show time
Hurry, hurry step right up
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is
(Marshall)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you
(Marshall)
You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is back
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh god, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of nine one one, so
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy Bat Syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was till everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already know who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so levy?
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg for sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre
Whuddup?
Can I get a hell yea?
Hell yea
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell yea
So there you have it folks
Marshall
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because
Marshall
And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall
So until next time friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall
Oh hah
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?
Hi kids, do you like violence?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails
Through each one of my eyelids?
(Uh, huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
(Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
(Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
(Umm)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead"
Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted
Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard
I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut
(Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
(Oww)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians
In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
(Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Aah)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away
(Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
(Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
(Hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
(C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me, mom?
(Wah)
You ain't got no tits
(Wah)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
(Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think, that I worship the devil
That I do all types of, retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you? Good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' a Limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this
Livin' amuk, never givin' a fuck, gimme the keys I'm drunk
And I've never driven a truck but I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes, can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah fuck you too
For everytime I reminisce, yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match, "Here momma try 'em on"
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
Causin' hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes, can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah fuck you too
For everytime I reminisce, yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a click, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck, I was born during the earthquake
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes, can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah fuck you too
For everytime I reminisce, yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
Don't stop
Don't stop
[Royce Da 5' 9"]
Yeah, Bad and Evil is (BACK)
We bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
This is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
Oh once again where I fail from blundering
Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
Now I'm freefallin'
My career is gone and the weed callin'
Regardless of who's fault I was b-ballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Marshall double backed and got me from on top of the Hearse
I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
Cause I done cried Mary J Blige rivers
I realized that God's with us as soon as I decided to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
The writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z
Suddenly everybody calls
"Like I'm just checking on you dog"
While I throw up this message on the star
[Chorus]
When them bottles stop poppin'
And them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and dont stop (dont stop)
I made a promise to my momma
I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters dont stop (dont stop)
I'm living proof nigga
Its pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
Its the Worldwide American way
I'm living proof nigga
[Eminem]
Your body language is sayin' your confidence is gone
Well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on
You just gone sit there and take it or make em suck it
Tell em where to shove it straight up (?)
Fuck it,
The last time the light kicked me in the ass
I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophy it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop ass
Did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I aint poop
Shit, the day that I dont straight shoot
I'll drop out of my anti-women hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon
Got my swagga back I was dragging, hop back on it
Grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em
Without remorse man
Man of course I'm a one trick pony
Cause I'll be screaming on these horns till I'm hoarse!
[Chorus]
[Royce Da 5' 9"]
Nah I aint fading yet
I'd rather stay and rap
I mighta made a deck
I find excitement in wondering what I'ma write next
So I dont stay in debt
Me broke
You might aswell cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby
With AK's with baby bayonet's
I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying
Thats why its either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homocide Ryan
[Eminem]
Theres a bomb inside my head
I'ma live wire, I am on the edge
Teetering on it like I tore the iron mike
Get on a nut like a tyre iron
I have no desire stopping so why would I drop and roll
Thats how much I'm flying higher (?)
Rappers are fun and I'm the time cause I'm just flying by 'em
Man I'm laughing at 'em the entire time, why am I up?
Cause tribulations I have triumphed bitch I'm fired up
So it's time for me to slit your fucking lighter, light the sky up
[Chorus]
[Tony Yayo]
Yeah! You riding with the talk of New York, Tony Yayo
Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins, here we go!
[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Niggaz, know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get to close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day
[Obie Trice]
Niggaz when I step up in a bar, faggots wanna loot
like you muh'fuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gon' stand here as a man and
let some queer ass, funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz vibes
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggaz we leave early cock back surely
Open up your fade your grade brain meets Motor City pave'
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay-Z
Hoes and animals skirts get murked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard
Trust in God cause youse about to get catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be with
Keep this secret {*whispers*} right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4-5 high make not give a fuck
[Chorus]
[Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty make your ass bet on words
Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish they last sents'
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
If thats the case then get a bigga one
You don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out the hood
That's a stereotype like everybody that's black and jumped
I'm in the white mink the fabric is done
Got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic, and them
Out of Dallas to the palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm in the cloud you don't see me on the trains
I travel first class you aint even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name cause I aint going back and forth
Your boss and your captain soft
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Cause we gon' bring it to anybody who want it
You want it?  You gon' get it
name 'em we gon' hit 'em chew 'em up and spit 'em out {*hoch spit*}
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
we gon' fuck you up with 'em
I got to much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step to them (Broom)
You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill
Did in the 90's when you was in diapers still
Shady Records you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough secondhand to make my fucking P.O. choke
I'm an OG, your fucking with a G.I. Joe
Bia Bia, mia mio a vida loco
I'm a pyscho Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spittin baby food on people
A tent siged on her ranch huddle up next to her
with Hello Kitty slippers on, humpin her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back or your shit pushed in
I put my blade in you like a fuckin pin cushion
slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Hen-dawg
I'll show you to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco ese?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Shay... D and the 'D' is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months
I'm having an E party for Easter please come
Cause we-
[50 Cent]
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it you want you gon' get it
You Name 'em and will hit 'em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out {*spits*}
To much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a twelve gauge Mausberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around you know how I get down
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it ends cause the bad guy die
If you tryin to buy guns from a nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on them they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fend to touch some
When I raise my knife shit I fend to cut some
See I walk like Ron O' Neil but talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me
{*laughing*}
[50 Cent] Sorry Kim
[Eminem]  Oh Sorry, Oh
[Chorus]
[Eminem]   Soul Assassins y'all, what up Muggs?
[DJ Muggs] What up Em?
[Eminem]   We outta here...
We should do something like that
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again it's the illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'til we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is hip hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Drezy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass, 50 Cent
Nah, 'em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass
The clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks
The Fif'll tell you're ass apart
A came in this game
Crush a motherfuckers from tha start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy
Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows
You're rockin' with the kid that spit sicka sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
E'eryday Dre day, front and 'cause a maylay
Turn the town upside down wit a frown upside down
I smile through sumthin' fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, go 'head, funky funk up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, it's the re-up
Shady
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
[Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back.
Say it on tape and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back.
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that.
Doubt startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black.
Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack.
But they don't know what dope is.
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this.
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest.
You picked me up, breathed new life in me. I owe my life to you.
Before the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do.
But it just dawned on me; you lost a son. See this light in you? It's dark.
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you.
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue.
'Cause me and you, we're like a crew. I was like your sidekick.
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this f-cking mic,
Or you gon' hug me. But I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do cause... 
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long 
I'm running out of time 
I need a doctor 
Call me a doctor 
I need a doctor, doctor 
To bring me back to life 
[Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle.
You come to me with ideas.
You say that these are pieces, so I'm puzzled.
'Cause the sh-t I hear is crazy,
But you're either getting lazy, or you don't believe in you no more.
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form.
Can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself,
Second guessing, and it's almost like your begging for my help. 
Like, I'm YOUR leader.
You're supposed to f-cking be MY mentor. 
I can endure no more!
I demand you remember who you are!
It was YOU, who believed in me,
When everyone was telling you, don't sign me. 
Everyone at the f-cking label, lets tell the truth. 
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you.
Nobody wanted to f-ck with the white boy...
Dre, I'm crying in this booth.
You saved my life, now maybe it's my time to save yours. 
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more.
But I ain't giving up faith, and you ain't giving up on me.
Get up Dre! I'm dying, I need you, come back for f-ck's sake
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long 
I'm running out of time 
I need a doctor 
Call me a doctor 
I need a doctor, doctor 
To bring me back to life 
[Dr Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the sh-t like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said was riding to the death
But where the f-ck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim
F-ck all you fairweather friends
All I need is him
F-cking backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the f-cking wrath of aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the f-ck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little cracker jack beat making wack math,
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I leave
And I guarantee they'll scream, Dre don't leave us like that man cause...
[Chorus]
Im about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
[Intro- talking]
{Eminem]
Shady, Aftermath
(BTOV) {nate dogg]
aye bitch, hey!
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control
hey hey Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Creek
[Bobby Creek]
I'm on the patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone
Cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer
For any nigga wid Hammer
But I came here to get on goose and tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice
In your caboose
Sippin everything from white grain
To deuce juice
With nothin' to gain
But my grace and loose tooths
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too
Bobby creek is in the place
The name is snoop too
But they might been around
My drinks is 10 around
I can make her spin around
If she keep her dinner down
Simmer down
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I'll let you in ya work
Come sip on my gum drops
yeah
[Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
We bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin for a girl
That will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up
[Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
[Eminem]
O' Trice!
[Obie Trice]
One slug
Couldn't snuff young 'cause
Goodness gracious
Haters stay on his nuts
One just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Serious
Full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the cool blue back
With a blue new rag
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
Its true that I had a few
Obie rollin' with brews
aint that annual annually knockin' the boots
It's on manual
The way I knock em outta they shoes
Talk a little shit
Then they anus'll ooze
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Who
It's shady
You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you
In the mansion
With a magnum
With a night came to the matinee
mathers, nate, Obie
Came to party
You better ask somebody
[Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shady
First word, excrement
Exclimate, is that what you said?
My next defense, against these extra men
Who try to step to me and wanna have sex again
(Vaseline)
You little sickass, I'll spray em with gasoline
They try to jack me off with Vaseline
My ass is mean, I smash your spleen
When I crash the scene
(Cell phone)
With a cell phone, now who the hell is home?
Y'all can't tell Paul how to throw me words
(Animal crackers)
Cause animal crackers is what I do when I eat MC's like a cannibal backwards
Ha ha, I got it, that's not it
Fake rappers been spotted
(Broken headphones)
Like broken headphones, you head home, you sped home
You get your head blown, rappers try to step, they speak in the dead tones
So I ain't trying to hear them, give me another, word for your mother
(Stretch Armstrong)
Stretch Armstrong, my brother, coming with rhymes every time that I be drumming
Running with this shit when I kick a bitch in the stomach
And star wars, this car's a Taurus
Yo, how many bars we hit tonight, cause I'm drunk off
(Peanut butter)
Off peanut butter, you see my dick and you start to stutter
Start to utter, words that you shouldn't utter
(Mark Whalberg)
Cause Mark Whalberg is a small turd, and I'ma step on him like dogshit
A fore fist, so rappers just get off it, I come across with
(Pulp fiction)
With pulp fiction, yo I'll eat you like a big gulp addiction
Like slurpees, got herpes, got a hair piece, rest my anises(?)
Got brain damage, I'm dumber than rain man is
There's mayonnaise on this, I need a plain sandwich
Hurry up, give me one, rappers try to step to this static they wanna give me none
(Fresh vegetables)
With fresh vegetables, my testicles are hanging off to the left of you
You're bisexual, and there's a guy next to you, standing, rappers know that I
be-
(Preparation H)
Preparation H, you didn't even let me finish my rhyme
Just shut up for one more time, while I just shine, on this
Microphone, cause I'ma be honest, any MC who tries to step to this
I'm making you a promise, that what? Give me a word
(Nostradamus)
That Nostradamus is blowing up your house, killing your foster mammas
And coming back to get your parents, well I have it
These rhymes are fourteen karat, solid gold
Rappers step to me, you get your wallet stole
(Times Square)
In Times Square, I got blonde hair, I'm higher than con air
Rappers don't want to see me, I'll butt fuck Goldie Hawn bare
In a lawn chair, cause I'm there
(Kurt Russell)
With Kurt Russell, saying ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"come here Goldie, you want my love muscle?ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
I know you want it, I get blunted, then I
Kick these, freestyles just like whipped knees
(Taxicab)
With a taxicab, I'll smack a bitch with a maxi pad
Where we going? Don't ask me dad
Leave me alone, I'm not trying, to even hear you
Dad, I hope you're fucking dying, off this porno mag
Yo, did you see my ad? Yo, wait a minute, did you see my ass?
Is what I meant to say, I meant to say a rhyme that goes this way is elementary
For the century, Slim Shady's is gonna be the illest
(Flamingos)
What? Flamingos? My mother goes out and plays bingo
Every single day, at the bingo hall, that's why my dick is single, small
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?
(DT's fired)
But DT's fired, he's retired, he's not hired, yo plus I'm tired
Of busting and spitting this rhyme nonstop, I'm on top
Taking records to the pawnshop, stretch
Damn, see my big ick? Catch
Put a D in front of it, rappers don't want none of it
Coming with a ton of shit to spill, Slim Shady out, I get ill with the skill
Baby, aight baby, Slim Shady
Kick eighty million rhymes, till I'm older than Grady
Spilled gravy, all over my damn navy blue avi
Bye bye
Good mornin
Haha, wake your mother f**kin arses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleepin on my roof bitch
For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped
Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't
rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back
into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion 
Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin 
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but
I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit B
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do
fifty!
I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl
acci-dently (argghhh!!)
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with
me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother f**kers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother f**kers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother f**kers an join in
Everybody come on an
[Swifty]
?? the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
F**k slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious
In a house full of dog shit, 
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin 
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin free when 
You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a botique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother f**kers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother f**kers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother f**kers an join in
Everybody come on an
[Kuniva]
Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like 
'What tha f**k did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk 
I mean these niggas squeeze on me 
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you 
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say "f**k you bitch, and I don't like you,
WHAT!" 
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just f**k an leave D12 and this blunt 
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life
[Kon Artis]
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it 
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back 
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you comin
[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother f**kers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother f**kers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother f**kers an join in
Everybody come on an
[Featuring Swift  Bizarre  Fuzz] 
[Bizarre] 
Yeah...ha ha ha (BANG!)  Yeah  Bizarre Kid comin' at you 
Eminem and Fuzz  and Mr. Swifty  ha ha 
No one's iller than me (wha?) 
No one  no one is iller than me 
No one is iller than me 
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313... 
[Swift] 
I make rappers wanna turn into singers 
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers 
Bring this competition and face this meanin' 
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas 
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius 
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters 
Keep it close, you can't beat us 
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this 
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects 
While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret 
That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state 
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate 
I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell 
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals 
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail 
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well 
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials 
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels 
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now 
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how? 
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild 
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW! 
It's Swifty from the 313 
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh! 
[Bizarre] 
Me and Eminem and Mike 
Drivin' down Van Dyke 
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite 
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason 
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin' 
Last week this old man I had to blast 
'cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas 
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook 
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook 
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack 
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at 
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should 
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good! 
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route 
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell "EVERYBODY GET OUT"! 
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece 
'cause she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece 
No one, no one's iller than me 
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313 
No one, no one is iller than me 
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313 
[Eminem] 
Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy 
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly 
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs 
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs 
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs 
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs 
Down a fifth, crack open a six 
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss 
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends 
Who gives a fuck who they was 
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does 
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz? 
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz 
Mics get sandblasted 
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your 
antacid 
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it 
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket 
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted 
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic 
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic 
Furious four motherfuckers 
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters 
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me 
[Fuzz] 
I run shit like an ass with legs 
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red 
Similar to your ass in a casket dead 
Drastic spread of acid heads 
Come to abort you like a bastard egg 
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs 
Ask the feds from past the edge 
Rockin' the most classic threads 
Flashin' bread, roll down the window 
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red 
You can get 'til that ass get red 
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him 
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem 
Never writer's block, I block writers 
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters 
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick 
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK! 
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' "Stop it..." 
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit 
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick 
Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits 
I shoot a rocket through your optic 
You niggaz still don't know the top pick? 
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass 
And have you shittin' socks bitch! 
We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split 
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits 
(No one...) 
Ain't nobody iller than me 
[Bizzare] 
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313 
No one, no one is iller than me 
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313 
No one, no one is iller than me 
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313 
You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees! 
From the home of potholes and trash 
We'll lyrically blast... 
Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Niggas Know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth I don't care
but if you get too close I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day
[Obie Trice]
Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna loot
like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
shoot up clubs and destroy nigga's vibes
everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
O's an animals skirts get mirked
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
trust in guard it cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be with
keep this a secret right by the nuts
a 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck
[Chorus]
[Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
and make my cash stretch longer than giraff necks
poverty will make your ass bet on words
touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents'
they say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
if that's the case then get a bigga one
you don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out of the hood
that's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I where a white mink, the fabric is done
got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them
out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
living lavash, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains
I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, cause I don't going back and forth
your boss and your captain's soft
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gonna get it
name them and we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out
too much venom and if you role with 'em
we gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much of my men movin in my direction to lose
my shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BROOM)
you know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assasins
ski masks and gloves consider this as a warning
disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
but we are fizast, fuck your litte bitch ass up
we are not killers, my vato will have you shot though
drag through the varrio and fucked like Kim Osario
litte sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real
we burn source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill
did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
shady records you better believe the hype is real
this is no joke, I don't smoke
but I toke enuff second hand to make my fuckin P.O. choke
I'm an OG, you're fuckin with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah aint got shit on me
when I retire I'll be spittin baby food on people
a tent sieged on her ranch, huddled up next to her
with Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
you ever had your cat pealed back or your shit pushed in
I put my blade in your like a fucking pin cushion
slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dogg
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco essay?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm slim sha...dy and the "d" is for deez nuts
and you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party for Easter please come
[50 Cent]
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gonna get it
name em and we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out
too much venom and if you role with 'em
we gonna fuck you up with 'em
you can do all those push ups to pop up your chest
I got a 12 gauge mossberg to pop up your chesthave you gasping for (Air)after that shell hit your vest
fear me like you fear god cause I bring death
Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down
I watch gansta flicks and root for the badguy
and turn it off before it ends cause the badguy die
if you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to
so what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
you can raise your voice like you (feeling)to touch something
when I raise my knife shit I'm(feeling)to cut something
see I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
if the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me
haha Sorry Kim haha)
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Souls Assasins y'all
What up Muggs?
[DJ Muggs]
What up Em?
[Eminem]
We outta here...
Lotto:
Yo its time to get rid of this coward right here once and for all
Im sick of this mother fucker check this shit out
Hah hem yo
I'll spit a racial slur honkey, sue me
This shit is a horror flick but the black guy doesn't die in this movie
Your doing lotto dogg you gotta be kidding
That makes me believe you really don't have a interest in living
You think these nigga's gonna feel with the shit you say?
I got a better chance joining the KKK
Off some real shit though I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck lotto call me your leader
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from leave it to beaver
I used to like that show
Now you got me in fight back mode, but oh well if you got to go, you got to go
I hate to do this I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
All's well that end's ok
So I'll end this shit with a fuck you but have a nice day
Eminem freestyle:
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the beaver
So was Eddie Haskell, Wally and Miss Cleaver
This guy keeps screaming he's paranoid
Quick someone get his ass another steroid
Blah be do blah blah do be blu blah
I ain't hear a word you say Hibbidy who blah
Is that a tanktop or a new bra?
Look snoop dogg just got a fuckin boob job
Didn't you listen to the last round meathead?
Pay attention your saying the same shit that he said
(I'm a fuck you up)
Matter of fact dogg here's a pencil
Go home write some shit make it suspenseful
And don't come back until something dope hits you
Fuck it, you can take the mic home with you
Lookin like a cyclone hit you
Tanktop screaming "Lotto I don't fit you!"
You see how far them white jokes get you
Boy's like "how vanilla ice gonna diss you?"
My motto fuck lotto
I'll get the 7 digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow
Whatever.. 
Dre, just cum and bum Aiyyo ram it up a little bit Aiyyo.. 
this song is for the gay one.. fuck it Just shut up and listen, 
aiyyo..
I sit back with this pack of dur-ex,
and this bag of these balls,
it gives me the shit needed to be the most gayest MC,
on this...on this Earth,
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just blert,
And just blurt up this ass and bizarrea ass at work,
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension,
dispensin this constapation,
Gettin this stress that's been me eatin recently and gettin hairs on my chest,
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully).. 
but at least I have the decency when Im in you to be good to ur hole, 
when you freaks see me up in this hole,
when I'm eatin out or bonin your daughter to not come and speak to me (speak to 
me).. 
I don't know you and no, 
I don't ho you are a mo-therfuck-in ugly thing I listen to N'Sync, 
I am what your friends think I bum Mr. Friendly, 
with my big dick after u bum me my tank is on empty (is on empty).. 
No cum is in me and if you dont pleasure me I'm penetrating with my 10 feet 
(with my 10 feet).. 
in the air I don't care who is there and who saw me just bum you 
Go call you a hooker, 
file you a blow job I'll smile in the whorehouse and buy you a lap dance I'm 
tired of all you (of all you).. 
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me
Chorus
And I am, however gay u say I am If I wasn't, 
then why would I bum this man? 
In the paper, the news everyday I am Porno channels wont even show my nan Cause 
I am, however gay I am If I wasn't, 
then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the gay I am
Sometimes I wanna feel my birds father, 
I hate to feel bothered with all of this nonsense it's constant 
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content thats all the songs with 'Elton' has gotten 
such rotten responses" 
And this penis circles me and it seems like the media immediately sticks a 
finger up me (finger up me).. 
So I point one back up 'em, but not the index or pinkie or the ring or the 
thumb, 
it's the one you put up when you just wanna fuck, 
when you won't just give up till this guy just screams stop, 
cause they full of cum too 
When a dude's gettin bummed and screams in his school 
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin Where were the 
parents at? 
And look where it's at 
Straight America, now it's a tragedy 
Now it's so sad to see, an upper ass i-t-y havin this happenin (this 
happenin).. 
then attack Eminem cause I cock slap this gay (cock slap this gay).. 
But I'm glad cause they bum me an feed me the fuel that I need is just fired to 
burn and it's burnin and I have returned
Chorus
I'm so stiff and hard off bein admired that I wish that I would just fly or get 
fired in 
and get cock dropped from my table and stop with the shavin' 
I'm not gonna be able to top  'Elton's gayness' 
And bum-holed into sensation by a cockney sensation at rock'n'roll stations And 
I just do not got the patience (got the patience).. 
to deal with these cockney caucasians who think 
I'm some queer who just tries to hump blacks cause I talk with an accent, and 
grab on their balls, so they always keep askin the same fuckin questions 
(fuckin questions).. 
are you some kind of queer?, what kinda queer you be up in? 
The why, the up what when, the where, and the how 
'til I'm grabbin my pubes and I'm tearin them out cause they ridin' me crazy 
(ridin me crazy).. 
I can take it I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and then shit And I'm thankful for 
ev-ery man that I get 
But I can't take a tug, in the bathroom without someone trying to suck it No I 
won't bone ur ass You can cum up my asshole, I'm glad 
Chrous
^^^ As much as I hate eminem this is the worst dis of all time, grow a sack faggot.
Women Singing: 
Tonight  Tonight  Tonight  Tonight  Tonight 
Verse 1: 
I'm getting mad love  I'm snuggling hugs 
Druggling thugs  smuggling drugs  juggling jobs  guzzling jugs 
So here's a toast to federal checks 
Hetero sex  unaffordable medical debts  huh 
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks 
To find babbling Max  gaffling tracks 
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts 
The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax 
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit 
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split 
Then I buried the hatchet, I carried on my back 
Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it 
Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two 
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you 
Back home when the party ends 
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints 
To the finest women in the audience 
Chorus: 
Women Singing: 
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics) 
Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight 
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight 
Cause we came here to do this tonight 
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright 
Cause we came here to do this tonight 
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight 
Cause we came here to do this tonight 
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright 
Verse 2: 
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandealous 
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist 
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter 
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters 
I think a living never meant for me 
Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally 
When I stumbled upon this resolution 
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution 
You couldn't see me with binoculars 
I armed like an octopus 
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed 
Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back 
Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act 
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it 
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it 
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented 
You got the point when I cleverly said it 
Chorus: 
Women Singing: 
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics) 
Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight 
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight 
Cause we came here to do this tonight 
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright 
Cause we came here to do this tonight 
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight 
Cause we came here to do this tonight 
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright 
Verse 3: 
Eminem is heading skyward 
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece 
of plywood 
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me 
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony 
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous 
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was 
I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this 
I'm hazardous enough already as it is 
Without you adding fuel to the fire 
I'm cruel to the liar 
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire 
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical 
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow 
I'm sure the party people can agree 
That I'm enchanting, with the romantic 
Freaking the vocals so frantically 
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere 
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like 
Chorus: 
Women Singing: 
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics) 
Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight 
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight

Cause we came here to do this tonight 
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight 
Cause we came here to do this tonight 
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Now Cashis, tie die on the [Incomprehensible] gangsta ****
Young Money, yeah
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open bibles
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niqqas know I lay 'em down, make you beg
Bitches, try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niqqas skipping scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
Ok, you want me up in the cage then I'll come out in beast-mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood Gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say, just
Don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And you don't hurt me
You don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love, no love
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love
And I don't need you no more
Get 'em
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin
To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fixin' to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat them, so why the fuck would I join them when I beat them?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'mma let you finish in a minute, yeah, the rap was tight
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game, I self-started a Roc fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm staying on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say, just
Don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love
You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And you don't hurt me
You don't hurt me, no more
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love, no love
Bitch, you get no love, no love, no love
And I don't need you no more
Bitch, you get no love
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh, no
I won't back down, oh, no
Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe De Villes
Brain dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth and nails
Try to fight it, try to deny it
Stupid you will feel, what I do, I do at will
Shooting from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death bed
Screaming F that yeah super Ill
Baby, what the deal, we can chill
Split half a pill and a happy meal, fuck a stank slut
I cut my toes off and step on the receipt before I foot the bill
Listen garden tool don't me introduce you to my power tool
You know the fucking drill
How you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?
Summers eve Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal, baby, crank the shit
'Cause it's your God damn jam
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shawty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said
Settle ya fuckin ass down I'm ready for combat, man
Get it calm Batman?
Nah, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like mum's cat scans
Cause they fucking dope bananas, honey I applaud that ass
Swear to God man these moms can't dance, ma show 'em how it's done
Spazz like a goddamn Tas, yeah
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh, no
I won't back down, oh, no
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinsons
Make like Michael J Fox in the jaws playin' with a etch a sketch
Betcha that you'll never guess who's knocking at your door
People hit the floors
Yeah, tonight ladies, you gon get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with
Chris's paws like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue muthfucker
You ain't gotta lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their draws
Think you spit the raw, I'm an uncut slab of beef
Laying on your kitchen floor
Other words I'm off the meat rack, bring the beat back
Bring me two extension chords
I'mma measure my dick, shit, I need 6 inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch
Need I remind you that I don't need the fucking swine flu
To be a sick pig, you're addicted I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here
Need a fix up I'm the big shot, get it dicks nuts
Your just small boats little pricks
Girl you think that other pricks hot
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
'Fore I sit back and let 'em get hot
Better call the cops on 'em quick fast
Shady's right back on your bitch ass
White trash with half a six pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitched attached to the back
(Dispatch)
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh, no
I won't back down, oh, no
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping
Does a bird chirp?
Does Lil Wayne slurps syrup 'til he burps and smokes purp?
Does a word search gets circles wrapped around it like
You do when I come through, I'd like you to remind yourself
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
Or your the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Psych I'm spiking you like a football
Been this way since I've stood a foot tall
Your'e a good catch with a shitty spouse
Pretty mouth and a good jaw
Gimme good brain
Watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain
Bitch, you listening tryna' turn me down
Slut I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shits playin'
I'ma shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder there's lightening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate ocassions?
And you can bet your stanking ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road took the pyschopath
Poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
So hit the dance floor, cutie
While I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty shawty I'm the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me Doodi
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh, no
I won't back down, oh, no
Yeah, woo, shit
Aight
Guess what? I ain't coming in yet
I'll come in a minute
Aye yo, this is my love song
It goes like this
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gonna probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And every thing's spinning, you're beginnin' to think
Women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guiness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you
Get in your car, start it and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Look at the life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now, where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so
'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell them, "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucka, all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me
In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
17 years later I'm as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
As ecstasy got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
We just met but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, "Yo, what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I have got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna
Catch up sooner or later but fuck it, I'm on one, so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord so it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more
'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell them, "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucka, all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all, wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning? And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'Cause none of the shit is gonna mean shit where we're going
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
To better drugs and updated
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Haley while Haley's out getting smashed
'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell them, "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucka, all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me
'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got ahold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell them, "No"
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucka, all I gotta say
These drugs really got ahold of me
Drugs really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me
These drugs really got ahold of me
They really got ahold of me

The streets is like a curse **** frontin' for a ****
It's like you beggin' to die like bear huntin' with a switch
A part of my heart is gone I could never smile the same

Detroit is hella dirty but the dozen can fix it
Resist and the biscuit will exceed the distance
And bounce off one's home hit and riquoche off a kid's trombone
Right to where you **** lay

Y'all shed tears but y'all can get your feel of it today

Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from cash mouth is fixin'
Ready with dope **** I'm ever dissin'

The surface of the street  when I walk through the door
My purpose is to move up pull tools you perpin'

Plot up and line up solo mia
Prayin' to proof I'm searchin' for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother gone in the streets of the D
I'm talkin' to **** and hopin' **** waitin' on me

And when the wars on the other side, me and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques my contracts signed just for scraps
To get you wack ****

Take a **** through the lung, get you right what you rappin' ****

Shady
It's the re-up
Come on hey hey we goin' to the beach 
grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat. 
Where's Mama? 
She's takin' a little nap in the trunk 
Oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk. 
now I know what you're thinkin': 
it's kind of late to go swimmin' 
but you know your mama she's one of those types of women 
who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a 
fit 
don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it 
and don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful? 
don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle? 
and mama said she wants to show how far she can float, 
and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat 
it's just a little scratch it don't hurt, 
her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on 
her shirt 
mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water 
and me and you can play by ourselves, can't we? 
just the two of us (sung) repeat 8-9 times 
there's a place called heaven and a place called hell, 
a place called prison and a place called jail, 
and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one, 
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson 
and you don't want a brother do ya? (Na) 
maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll 
explain it to ya. 
but for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad 
she was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad 
but I still feel sad that I put her in time out, 
sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out 
I told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba? 
take a night-night, nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga 
humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty, 
clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty. 
you're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water, 
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter. 
just the two of us (sung) 
wake up sleepy head we're here, 
before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the 
pier. 
baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea, 
mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear, 
that's why you can't get her to wake, 
but don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the 
lake, 
here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock? 
we'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock. 
ready now, here we go, on the count of three, 
one, two, three...weeeeeeeeee 
there goes mama splashin' in the water, 
no more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order, 
no more step dada, no more new brother, 
blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her, 
we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk, 
but first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk, 
just the two of us (sung) 
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em, quickest damn gun slinger I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold blood, that ol' saloon there was their lil' home
Away from home, they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live
In that tavern and on a quiet night, you can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil, intelligence level is hellier than
Treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missiles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations
Collaborating, attemptin' to take over the earth
'Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Segal
Above the law 'cuz I don't agree wit police either
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle
I breathe ether in three amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
He's insane, no I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off 'cuz I can't find a decent vain
The disaster wit dreads
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cuz I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows crackin' jaws
Wit my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' MC's, at the same time amazin' MC's
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt
Hello? Billy, aiyyo what's up
We're comin' to get you
Stop, they know it's us
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down
Well I'm out now, and this time
I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gone leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
'Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
We'll be waitin', See you in hell
Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel, bye bye
Bad meets evil, what? Till next time
{And so that's the story when bad meets evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that ol' saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Wait, did y'all hear that?}
The Armageddon Freestyle  EMINEM
fucker

Oh shit, it's the evil genius 
Green lantern

The invasion
You have part one u got part two now its

The final chapter mother fuckers
Armageddon, lets go
I got a riddle what's little and talks big 
with midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
that will do anything to throw dirt on my name 
if it means walkin the whole Mediterranean
isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
his name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow
but that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe
rappin in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo, so
either except it or you don't and lets move on 
if I've shown that I've grown and get the bone 
keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts 
keep walkin around sniffin each others butts
or should I say asses 
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
hold up hold up hold up
new york city man
it's the kid Lloyd Banks
and it u hearin what I'm hearin right now 
you know this aint no regular shit homy
this something special and we gotta bring this back
Green common
countdown to armageddon
lets go
I got a riddle what's little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
that will do anything to throw dirt on my name 
if it means walkin the whole Mediterranean
isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
his name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow
but that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe
rappin in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo so
either except it or you don't and lets move on 
if I've shown that I've grown and get the bone 
keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts 
keep walkin around sniffin each others butts 
or should I say asses 
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
the question I ask is 
how can I explain this 
how can I swing this in English language 
if I switch to slang and turn man to man 
do I do it in vain or simply to entertain 
am I bein real or am I bein fake 
am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine 
or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter 
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya 
I'm tell ya one me (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in 
but every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration 
or should I say or should I say shun 
is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism 
your face is numb your stunned your look is cold 
like that of a man of seventy some years old 
and it only gets colder which Is why I understand 
and cant be mad at a forty four year old fan 
with a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine 
and the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again 
only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown 
papa cant stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down 
in his new chair that goes round and round 
that he bought from new money in his bank account 
that I get him every issue when the thang comes out 
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out 
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side 
yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide 
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride 
but aint nobody over here buyin two white guys disguised as pro black
there is no slack 
far heart for college grat. In a fitted hat and a hunch back 
standin by the clearance coat rack 
in some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs 
yeah
shady in the place to be c 
and it takes what I got to rock the mic right 
still not gonna cater these punks 
fuckin cocksuckin pussy lips haters dicks cunts
Whatever
Dre just let it run, aye yo, turn the beat up a lil' bit
Aye yo this song if for anyone, fuck it
Shut up and listen aye yo
I sit back with the pack of zig zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blirk, it's bazerk and bizare shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensin' me sentence is gettin' the stress that's been eatin' me
Recently off of this chest and I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter to not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a mutha' fuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N SYNC I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patients is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you
I'll call you a lawyer file you a law suite
I'll smile in the court room and buy you a wardsrobe I'm tired of arguin'
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be it's just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
I don't know that's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And oh it's his lyrical content the song 'Guilty Conscience'
Has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me and it
Seems the the media immediately
Points a finger at me so I point one back at 'em
But not the index or pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
Wit the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
When a dudes gettin bullied and shoos up the school
And they blame it on Marylin and the heroine
Where were the parents at? And look where its at?
Middle America now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Havin' this happenin' then attack Eminem
'Cause I rap this way? But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
That I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin, and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
I don't know that's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wished that I would just die or get fired
And drop from my label and stop wit the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a 'My Name is'
And pigeon hold in to some poppy sensation
That caught me rotating in rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience to deal
With these cocky Cau Casions
Who think I'm some wigger who tries to be black
'Cause I talk wit an accent and grab on my ball
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
'What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in'
The why, the who, what and the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearing it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacing, I stand then I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
You know I won't sign your autograph
You can call me and asshole, I'm glad
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
I don't know that's just the way I am

{Az-Izz}
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outz in a fear of family presents
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies
{Pace Won}
Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block,
I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what?
Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

{Slang Ton}
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever wanna get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills
Or steal my reel-to-reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is
And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges
{Eminem}
I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?)
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha)
Right off the top, then go back to the top
And then repeat it (Ha)
Write it down on the paper
And still be able to read it (Sorry)
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear)
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!)
I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outz for ten thou-sand years
({Pace Won} So dunn, here?)
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
Lauryn, huh? Hill?
({Pace won} There's more than one? IIIllll)
What? You want me to stop? Here?

Yea
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs
Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave
Yea, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome?
We selling twenty million albums
Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic
And push a Withe Ac, with a bike rack
{Axe}
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace
Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me
{Pace Won}

Ohh, it's music to my ears
Oh man, how can I describe the way I feel?
Fuckin' great, man
Okay, let me see, how could I begin?
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Cap'n Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch
Mariah, whatever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up? All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's goin' through you mind
After such a nasty break up
With that Latin hunk Luis Miguel
Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zap and Eric Clapton shaft brings Abba crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean I really want ya bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease for Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's goin' through my mind half the time
When my rhyme are blowin' up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the 'Vacancy' sign on 'cause I'm gone blowin' up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a mad man holdin' a glad
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whip, a trickster
My signature sound when the tube of lipsticks surround
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow, man
What an ensemble, what an assortment of pharmaceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama
I cut you like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowin' ya Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucka born
Snuck up on Malakai and made the motherfuckers suck
On a shucka corn
Shucka, shucka corn, shucka corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fuckin' on
Now what the fuck are ya doin'? You're runnin' over the snow blower
With the lawnmower blowing your bagpipes from Baghdad
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease for Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's goin' through my mind half the time
When my rhyme are blowin' up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the 'Vacancy' sign on 'cause I'm gone blowin' up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a mad man holdin' a glad bag
In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothin' will stop me from molestin' you
Titty fuckin' you 'till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what they said, to the two conjoined twins
"How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?"
You need some ointment, just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get goin', how bad does the goin' get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin' groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm goin' to get the needle and thread from the sowin' kit
And attempt to separate 'em, and stitch them back at the loins, shit
Knew the little boy with the chocolate chips, ahoy chip
Cookie looky, even took me a Polaroid
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease for Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's goin' through my mind half the time
When my rhyme are blowin' up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the 'Vacancy' sign on 'cause I'm gone blowin' up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a mad man holdin' a glad bag of
Bagpipes from Baghdad

Yo, I can't sing, I feel like singing
I want to fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy, yeah, I'm happy, ha ha
I got my baby back, yo, check it out
Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think, there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
My baby girl, keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, 'cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
Man if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'ma pistol packin' drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled
That hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin' three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should have seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothing can take her from me
I told you I can't sing, oh well, I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said if you ever need anything
Daddy will be right there? Well guess what?
Daddy's here and I ain't goin' nowhere baby, I love you
[Intro]
Aw man, yea
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?
[Verse 1]
You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, your pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump em ??
You're bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
I'm splitting your shit wide open, no stitches could save
So die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say isn't this great
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
They're starting to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene, but its too late
It's absolute pandemonium, whisked away
In a ambulance is your fate, nothing nobody told you when you-
Left your house today coulda made you anticipate
Such an ass whooping, okay, til the anger dissipates
You get punched in the face, reciprocate
[Chorus x2]
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a-mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
I said...
[Verse 2]
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace cuz shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how f--king rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat outta you, chill
Cuz if you doubt me you will, yea got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
This c--ksucker did not spill my drink, Oh HELL no
He must be tryna kill my buzz, I will not budge
And what the deal ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat
That's probably a record yea, you wasn't expecting that
Cuz they want in on the act, there's a cognac-
Bottle, we snuck it in cuz the beer that they were serving here was only tap
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like this guy might hurt me
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start a ?? you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out of, go powder your nose-
P--sy the harder you yell, the harder I slap the shit out of you hoes
You set it off fa--ot, so now how do you spose-
We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes
[Chorus x2]
It's shear hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us
And adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe
And ?? my signatures, ligature marks
Look at you all big with your remarks, and I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at you and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you, it's so sick, it's bizarre
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your frickin ligaments ARGH!
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails, for that-
You catch an open-hand slap, break off your nail like BAP!
In fact, I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
Where's D12, I don't feel like doing this by myself
[Chorus x2]
(Lil Wayne)
 I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m cursed, so never mind
And itÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢s worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a n*gga
But soon for a n*gga it be on, muÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢f*cka
ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‹Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, muÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢f*cka
So I pick the world up and IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma drop it on your f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ head
Bitch, IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma pick the world up and IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma drop it on your f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherf*cker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherf*cker
IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m gone
Motherf*cker, IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m gone
I know what they donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢t wanna tell you
Just hope youÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢re heaven-sent, and youÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢re hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is the stain they canÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢t wipe off
uh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and thatÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢s a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could pick the world up and IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma drop it on your f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ head
Bitch, IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma pick the world up and IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma drop it on your f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherf*cker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherf*cker
IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m gone
Motherf*cker, IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m gone (IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m gone)
(Eminem) It hurts, but I never show this pain youÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ve become, my backÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢s against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"F*ck ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‹em allÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages and
My vocal rhymes, got ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‹em cookinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢, boy
This crooked mind of mine got ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‹em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ clock
I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-f*cked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
F*ck this fame, that ainÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢t what
I came to claim but the game
AinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢t gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma make these f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ haters believe that
I swear to God, wonÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢t spare the rod
IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m a man of my word, so your f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ heads better nod
Or IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma f*ck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your headÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ll lie
Permanently, bitch, itÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢s beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m unstoppable, incredible
Hope youÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢re trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ headÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ll spin, dog
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives
IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ll f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢
Pick the world up and IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma drop it on your f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ head
Bitch, IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma pick the world up and IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ma drop it on your f*ckinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherf*cker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherf*cker
IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m gone
Motherf*cker, IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m gone (IÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢m gone)
Hey 'em, you know you my favorite white boy, right?
I, I owe you for this one
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's fifty
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long, yeah
If you thinking I'm a fucking fall off ya so wrong, it's fifty
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven sitting politic passengers from nine eleven
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at yo dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
Fifty fear no man, warrior, swinging swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand writing lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Looking for a slut wit a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringing again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's fifty
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long, yeah
If you thinking I'm a fucking fall off ya so wrong, it's fifty
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's fifty
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long, yeah
If you thinking I'm a fucking fall off ya so wrong, it's fifty
If ya patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you can even weather the storm
Unless you lay on the table they operating to save you
It's like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think they crazy but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit basically they just playing sick
They ain't shit, they ain't saying shit, spray 'em fifty
A to the K get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem, you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I getting through to you?
You know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothing spookier
Ya now about to witness the power of fucking fifty
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's fifty
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long, yeah
If you thinking I'm a fucking fall off ya so wrong, it's fifty
If the gun spark I'll hear all of the shots go off
It's fifty, they say it's fifty
See a nigga layed out with his fucking top blown off
It's fifty, man that wasn't fifty don't holla my name
You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch yo mouth
'Cause I'll break yo face
Have yo ass running, mumbling to the Jake
You going against me dog, you making a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave ya looking like the Michael Jackson jackets with all 'em zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
Yo bitch a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keeping her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in ninety four, "We don't love them hoes"
I got pennies for my thoughts now I'm rich
See the twenties spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood
They get filled up with holes motherfucker
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's fifty
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long, yeah
If you thinking I'm a fucking fall off ya so wrong, it's fifty
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on, yeah
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on, it's fifty
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long, yeah
If you thinking I'm a fucking fall off ya so wrong, it's fifty
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Last name, Ever, first name, Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy ain't nothin' to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I ball, Kimo
Drop the mix tape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcom
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks givin' me Mac lovin'
You'd think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You'd think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
You're such a fuckin' loser, he didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasin' that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Okay, hello it's da martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, to the top
Life is like a fuckin' roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park
My mind shines even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foots sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
There they go
Back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go
Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozo's
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck, no, go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waitin' patiently
For Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that
I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth, truth spillin'
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way
That you got at me, so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, son
Just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place
So Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm sellin' shit down at the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
Sh-sh-sh-Shady
Aftermath
G-G-G-Unit
'Cuz we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the Doctor
Come on now, here we go, cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh, yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you're something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'
'Cuz we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cuz Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record, what
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second, bump bump
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap, maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to
'Cuz we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
50 Cent, come on, bounce now, hands up, you know how we do it
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Six days up out the week
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never 'cuz Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc
And Shady, no one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
'Cuz we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Yeah, still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album, it's comin'
We gon' make Dre do it, 50 Cent, G-Unit
Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre, we ain't leavin', let's go
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace
{Just pull the plug!} 
People say that I'm a bad influence 
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it 
They say I'm suicidal 
Teenagers' newest idol 
C'mon do as I do 
Go ahead get mad and do it 
(repeat all 2x) 
[Eminem] 
Hand me an .8 
Beam me up and land me in space 
I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here} 
And shit on Brandy and Mase 
I'm more than ill 
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill {ahhh} 
Human horror film 
But with a lot funnier plot 
And people goin' feel me 'cause I'ma still be 
the mad rapper whether I got money or not {yup} 
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot 
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht 
But I would like an award 
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source 
And a wardrobe I can afford 
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford 
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for 
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a No Limit tank looks like 
a middle finger sideways flippin' me off 
No shit I'm a grave danger to my health 
Why else would I kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself 
{Just pull the plug!}

[Eminem] 
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners 
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters 
I'm meaner in action than Rosco beating James Tar Senior 
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch} 
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth 
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse 
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate 
since the third time that I failed 9th grade 
You probably think that I'm a negative person 
Don't be so sure of it 
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon} 
I laugh at the sight of death 
As I fall down a cement flight of steps (ahhhh) 
And land inside a bed of spider webs 
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend 
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again 
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out 
I'm blowing mine out 
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now 
{Just let it go} 
People say that I'm a bad influence

[Eminem] 
My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist 
Make you satanistic 
Make you take the pistol to your face 
And place the clip and cock it back 
And let it go untill your brains 
are rippin' out your skull so bad 
to sew you back would be a waste of stitches 
I'm not a "Role Model," I don't wanna babysit kids 
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business 
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off 
Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin me to dishwash 
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got 
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe Kim's got 
And the shit's almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got 
I know that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much 
And Just the Two of Us 
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life 
It's just words on a mic. 
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig 
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch
Yo mic check
Testing one, two um twelve
This is my dancing room can you hear me?
My favorite color is red
Like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobain's head
When he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shishkabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was livid now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AID's and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row signin' autographs until my show
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Coz I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphalis
Put my L.P on your Christmas gift list
You wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Coz I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was waving it at everybody screamin' "I suck"
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud "All of y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
But Eminem this is your record release party
I'm bored out of my gord
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot
To the floorboard of my Ford
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Coz they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D, it was like
G I don't know he might be
I told 'em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
And I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster"
I'm peace out then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out till I started bustin' freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
"Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"
I wanna make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Come on everybody, get down tonight

Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines 
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream 
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams 
You's a muther fucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper 
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen? 
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assasination 
Def jam grabbed him, told him reinact him you'll go platinum 
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins 
Reinacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy 
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in detroit motherfucker 
[Eminem] 
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da

A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyranasaurous Rex 
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond 
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse 
[Proof] 
Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas 
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas 
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on 
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones 
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas 
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us 
This real witness yall ain't caught the concept 
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats 
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source 
Threatning at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch 
Now Irv got the nerse to try serve on us 
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust 
[Kuniva] 
Do I gotta get my nigga bugz, punks like you get beat up 
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater 
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils 
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina 
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox 
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock 
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat

Look who decided to show his face! 
I hope you've had fun in the last 4 years. 
(Look man, I apologise again for-)
For shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?
(Again, it was a mistake,)
(a terrible mist- are you wearing a bulletproof vest?)
and then you go and you do what?
hide out? stay in Detroit from us 5 years while the music industry melts the fuck down? Do you know how many people lost their jobs because of your fuckin vacation? 
(Well that's actually why I'm here, I was gonna, put out some new music and I wanted to play it for you, and get your opinion)
Do I really need to hear it? 
Let me guess, another album about poor me, I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life, and I'm such a tortured artist. Let me make music about it and my tragic love life, am I on to something here?
(Come on man it's not like that yo-)
You know what? Just hand the fuckin thing over
I'm done talkin to you. Think you can just come and go as you please.
Big selfish superstar 
(Steve, I had a drug problem)
Oh poor me, I had a drug problem. Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town? You know what? 
*cocks gun*
(Hey! hey!)
Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out
(Woah, woah, woah. Jesus Christ man! )
(Alright alright here, fine)
What's this shit? Two CD's?
(That's what I've been tryin to tell you man, there's 2 albums)
Just get out! (Alright!)
Get the fuck out (Alright man, see you later)
Artist: Eminem
Album: Encore- Track 3
Song: I love You More (Kim2)
Still love me? Take This (Clocks gun twice)
You ready? One, two, three! (gun fires twice)
Chorus
Cause the more you, put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me? I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
More that you slap me, more that it turns me on
Cause you love me and I love you more
Verse 1
It's sick but who could ever predict
We be doing the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us it's lust
Cause neither one of us trust each other
So we fuck 'till we bust 'till we cuss each other
Out, we know what it's about SHOUT
Said I throw you out the house,you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'till we turn this mother out
And apologize after laughter pain
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm laying here with you
There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do
Chorus
Verse 2
Cause I hate you do you hate me?
Good cause you're so fucking beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut but I'm equal I'm a mutt we're both people
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
They can make accusations people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof 'till they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me cause any chick could say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' Yeah I would
Cause the sex is too damn good
If I ran who would I run to? It would be this soften womb
So its off and on usually more off then on
But atleast we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope the only reason that I cope is cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why
Chorus
Verse 3
I can never understand it that's why I don't try
From junior high untill we both die
You silly oh why must we try is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goats Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs untill the other begs
We're lying to ourselves that's the beauty of it shit
Cause we truly love each other that's why we're always fight and
All we do is shove each other every other fucking night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change
It's pent up rage we've both had
We both feel like we been up staged by someone else
We've both been someone else's someone else's 
problem neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't 
be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzel don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time
On every song every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoop-la all the whoopty-woo
What you put me through fucking whoopty-doo
But I won't be made a fool of
If this is true love you wouldn't do what
You did last time you wouldn't screw up
This time cause this time girl I'm telling you what
You do it again I'm fucking you up
No matter what you say
Or what you do
I'm a hunt you down 'till I find you
No matter where you run
I'll be right there right behind you
In your nightmare
So I bought you some flowers
And the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
So when you hate me you goin' hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me whore
Chorus
Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah, yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now, ain't you momma?
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha, I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause, he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye?
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show'
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
These ideas are nightmares for white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearin'
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearin'
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone cold and he don't care
He's a problem child what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
'Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants two rags and a stockin' cap
His step father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose this house is a broken home
There's no control he just lets his emotions go
(C'mon)
Sing with me
(Sing)
Sing for the year
(Sing)
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is danger intertwine it with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Only you're unholy only have one homey
Only this gun lonely 'cuz don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
Or they can be great or even worse they can teach hate
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you attorney's all gonna turn it to
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
You need to spew don't hesitate to produce air guns
Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Swiftly just to get me off these streets quickly
But all their kids been listen to me religiously
So I'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, Pete
It's all political if my music is literal and I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you
Sing with me
(Sing)
Sing for the year
(Sing)
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
But can it load a gun for you and cock it too?
Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cos they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We're entertainers of course this shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishin' they die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cos we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on through out lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can
Sing with me
(Sing)
Sing for the year
(Sing)
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me
(Sing)
Sing for the year
(Sing)
Sing for the laughter
Sing for the tear
(C'mon)
Sing with me just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
A lotta people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know I'm back now, haha
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Dre, I'm down here under the ground
Dig me up, broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
60 sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of oxy pads
Enough oxy cotton to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Whack job in a bag and a black stalkin' cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxin' match
He can't say that, yes he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
You better text message to your next of kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
Throw a fuckin' lesbian in wetzy men
So faggidy, faggidy, faggidy, raggidy Ann and Andy
No, raggidy, Andy and Andy, no, it can't be, it can't be
Yes, it can be, the fuckin' Antichrist is back
Danny and Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity
Goddamn it, insanity pills, fanny pack filled with zanies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk negligee, lookie
Razor blades with me to make you bleed
Cases of Maybelline make up layin' on the table with weed
Slim Shady, shit sounds like a fable to me
Until he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Six semen samples, 17 strands of hair
Found at the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe and canopy beds
And glad bags, yeah, glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicadin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lighten the strikin', might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means is just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
So tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shootin' animal
Light up a cannon and have him catapult addin' a dog
Captain of the cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a trick or treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Voorhees with a 40
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in a fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' wiffle bat, Drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands, too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a triple fat goose
Insanity, can it be vanity? Where is the humanity?
And havin' a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it
Cut your fuckin' head off and ask you where you headed off to
Get it, headed off to? Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
So, it wasn't a choice, it was I had to do this
And now I got 90 days clean and that's all I have to share, thanks
Thanks for sharin', Brian, is there anyone else
Who would like to share this evenin'?
Yeah, I got somethin' to share
When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here, baby boy, just come here to me
You're a cock boy, everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So homie, lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down, lay down, down, down
Lay down, lay down
Where's everybody goin'?
This always went over real big in Gay A
Okay wait, I got another one
I just love condoms and lots of cum
No? Oh shit
Lord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Mama had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
But mama don't want me
The next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring, ring, ring on the doorbell
Of the next door neighbors on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither
So they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
Till somebody finally took me in
My Great Aunt and Uncle Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they'd gang up on me and sing this song
Sing this song, sing this song
Sing this song, sing this song
It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Mama, why do they keep saying this?
I just don't understand, understand
And by the way where's my dad?
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Predominately, predominately
Everything's always predominately
Predominately white, predominately black
Well, what about me? Where does that leave me?
Well, I guess that I'm between predominately both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting
What do I look like a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
What do I look like some kinda idi?
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit?
It's such bullshit it's touch this bitch
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions and his mansion
And his sorrow he's always drowning in
And the dad that he never had
And how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict
And his ex-wife how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it
That little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank
And take a bath in it
Man, if I only had half of it, shit
If you only knew the half of it
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned
Mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Santa's spawn
Never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why are you not coming this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserved this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairy tale
I'm about to be hosted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me
'Cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall
And take Halie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go
But life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now
Curtains up the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosy the show's over
You can all go home now
But the curtains just don't close for me
This ain't how fame was suppose to be
Where's the switch I can just turn off and on?
This ain't what I chose to be
So please God give me the strength
To have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 50 back the baton
The camera's on, my soul is gone
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Whoa nelly,
Tell Angelina Jolie i'm ready,
With petroleum jelly,
To smear it all over me belly,
And tell her she can hit me on me mobile, me celly,
And meet in the salami section of the grocery deli,
And maybe we can find us an appropriate telly,
A motel 6 or 8 it hink they both could be helly,
I fucked, then i quieted and told her email me,
And don't call me, i'll call you, can you feel me? Bitch do you smell me?
Animal instinct, cannabalistic, I just ran out of lipstick, man i'm a
twisted, sick, sadistic, son of a bitch
6-6-6, broke his crucifix made out of sticks then fixed it
Chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick
Now play it back-wards muscle relaxers mixed with,
Liquid,
The lie to this delutifar quick fix,
Your delusional illusions look realistic...
[Eminem]
Yeah boy,
Better ring the alarm boy,
Dem know its coming boy,
[Verse 1]
Oh my God, fucking Bomboclat
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire,
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, nothing but a broad boy,
I'm the real deal, and char grill on the bonfire,
And Bon Voyage bitch, I'm like Chef Boyar-
-dee in this bitch; send a bomb to my moms lawyer
Im a problem for ya, boy you think your Tom Sawyer,
Til I pull you out the fucking story book and stomp on ya,
Fucking fictitional characters and fariytales,
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels,
But it aint fiction its fact boy beware its real
Them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero shield
Mr fly by the seat of his pants parasail
Or hit the trampoline bounce and grab a pair of stilts,
And I aint wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada,
Lookin forward to fucking ya mada 
[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on em,
Please don't drop the bomb on me,
Shady please, please dont drop the bomb on me,
Drop the bomb on them,
I dont want the dog on me,
See aint no reason to set the dogs on me,
Drop the bomb on em,
Please don't drop the bomb on me,
Shady please, please dont drop the bomb on me,
Drop the bomb on em
I dont want the dog on me,
See aint no reason to set the dogs on me,
[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the real McCoy,
You little boys can't even fill voids,
Party's over kids, kill the noise,
Here come the kill joys,
Me and Dre steel alloys,
The rap crown royals,
Scout cowboys
Now how that sound for ya,
Yeah boy you know we about to put it down for ya,
So kick your shoes off,
Before you have a sound voyage,
And siyanara see ya fuckers tommorow,
Get some R and R and marinate in some marinara,
And have a coke and a smile, dont make me open a jar,
Whip ass on ya, thats the last straw your hoping to draw,
Yeah you fresher than most boy, I'm just doper than all boy,
I'm that boy boy, them boys (?)
I just show up go up to the stage and blow up the spot,
There aint no boy who can do what I do boy I'm a star,
Boy, I told you boy, I'm a Soldier boy, I'm DeShaun,
Holten in this bitch, I'm the Proof boy your a fraud,
I destroy you boy, fuck around and blow you to (?)
Oh my god boy, you didn't go there, no you did not,
I got a whole story board for you, boy your da plot,
Your gettin got whether you try to avoid it or not,
Apology not accepted boy, Detroit is a rock,
We get to beefing, aint no telling at what point it will stop,
All I got to do is point to the spot,
When the bomb drops boy does it drop,
And when it does boy there's a problem,
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Boy dont jinx yourself,
Boy I'm Michael Spinks with the belt,
String a bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I'm sick as hell boy,
You better run and tell someone else,
Bringin hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy who done said it :,
Who said he was better,
I bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,
Back better than ever,
The chedder shredder the grater the beef grinder
I'll settle vendettas a little later,
Giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
By saying shady was ghost I aint even close the gate (?)
You bout to be put in a grave, stay put and behave,
Im bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day
So hey wouldn't you say I'm the shit,
Couldn't agree with ya more fuel to say to my fucking shit doesn't stink,
Shady fucking aftermath boy the shit doesnt sink it just floats int he fucking water
Til we fill up the tank,
[Chorus]
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here
Chorus
You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run they mouth
and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)
Yo, you might see me joggin, you might see me walkin
You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin
(grrrr, ARF ARF) Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman ("God damnit!")
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?
Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned
passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it.. (hahaha)
Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screamin, "I don't care, just bite me" (nah nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
and call themselves "Clowns" cause they look queer
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
(AHHH!) Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females
in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
"Slim Anus," you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!
Chorus Two: Eminem
Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy,
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
if you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)
[Eminem]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"
My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter you {*several seconds of silence*} faggot!
Talkin about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
and what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
uhh, here - DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself
Chorus One (2X)
May I have your attention please
Will the Reals Slim Shady plese stand up
I repeat, Will the real slim shady please standup
Were gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like yall never seen a white person before,
jaws on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door and started whoopin her ass worse than before they first got divorced and started throwin over furniture,
it's the return of the .. oh wait,no way, you're kidding,
he didn't just say what i think he did, did he?
and dr.dre said...
nothing you idiots dr.dre's dead he 's locked in my basement!
feminist women love Emimem chigg chika Slim Shady i'm sick of him, look at him, walkin around grabbin his you know what and flippin at you know who, yeah but he's so cute though,
yeah i prolly got a couple'a screws up in my head loose,
but no worse than whats goin on in your parents bedroom,
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose, but i cant,
but its cool for ??tom green?? to hump a moose,
 my bum is on your lips,
my bum is on your lips,
an if im lucky you might just give it a little kiss,
and thats the message we deliver to little kids and expect them not to know what a womans clitoris is,
of course they gonna know wat intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade the got the discovery channel don't they?
we aint nothin but mammals, well some of us are cannibals who cut other people open like antelopes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes,
then theres no reason that a man and another man can't elope,
but if you feel like i feel i've got the antidote, women wear your pantyhose, sing the chorus an it goes.
im slim shady yes im the real shady, all the other slim shady's are just imatating, so won't the real slim shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up,
im like a headtrip to listen, coz im only givin you things that you joke about with your friends inside your living room,
the only difference is i got the balls to say in front of ya'll an i dont gotta be short or sugar-coated at all,
 i jus get on the mike an spit it an whether u like to admit it,*riit* i jus shit it better than ninety percent of you rappers out there,
and you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums, its funny,
coz at the rate im goin when im thirty, i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirtin, pinchin nurses asses while im jackin off jerkin the gherkin and this whole bag of viagra isn't workin,
an every single person is a slim shady lurkin who could be workin at burger king, spittin on your onion rings, *** through the parkin lot circling screamin i don't give a fuck, with his windows down and his system up
so would the real slim shady please stand up, and put one of those fingers on each hand up, an be proud to be outta your mind, an outta control, and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
m slim shady yes im the real shady.....
[Intro]
You wanna start with the hook first?
You wanna start with the
Oh

Everybody get up, sit up Chris-stiffer
Been miserable without you Superman is a

Girl dont act like you never been kissed before 
One, two, three, four, five, six thisa 
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kissa
How did anybody ever find me I dissa
..Peared 
I was hiding in Freeway's beard jussa 
Hop, skip and a jump from my skin glision
Nails into my face that I been pushin'
Hellraiser
My face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic
I can squisha, sucka like a vice grip
My pen putcha, 
In the slaughter house cuz ya styles been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw
Take off like the blades on
My brain's on hyperdrive 
Someone put the brakes on.
[Chorus]
Here's a smidgen, admitted
To get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it
Err ribbit, ribbit

[Verse 2]
Slim is in the house simmer down there sister
Bound to get ya dizzy 
Cuz he gets as busy as a...
Bee baby you can throw a frizbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth
What is he? 
He's a wizard
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit
And i'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick is it?
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick witcha
I want a kiss before I blow this bitch to smith.. areens
Get the guillotines, this is a situ..
..ation is critical as Dre spins his a 
Turntables and he cuts a record like a scissa
Cheka chicka checka chicka cheka cheka chicka
We'll wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicka
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just a make a little breakfast and its sixa 
Clock in the morning unless you want to get some dizzert 
[Chorus]

Baby, your da-da loves you
And I'ma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you
Come on Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell, da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle?
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
See honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya?
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya but for now we'll just say mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryin' to climb out
I told you it's okay Hai-Hai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
Wake up, sweepy head, we're here, before we play
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock?
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fightin' wit' dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I
Just me and you baby
Is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be here for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you, baby
Yeah, you feel that, baby?
Yeah, I feel it too
Damn, you know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?
I'm the American dream, I'm the definition of white trash ballin'
I'm right back on 'em with a
I can't call it, same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
Whatchu' mean we ain't fuckin'? You take me for a friend?
Lemme tell you the whole story, of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must've got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my momma
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word of Johnny drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, I'm making a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me, I'm calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knee's, his legs, and his arms
I'ma superstar, girl, I'm ready for you momma
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?
So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo
First I'll kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told you ain't foolin' from the gate, this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for staying, April
I'mma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake g's
Skip over the huggy bear and all the kissy face please
Initiate phase 3, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously
Take your time, baby, oh, you're the bomb, baby
Oh, you're doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I'm shady, you didn't listen now, did you?
Relax, woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' with you
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm just
So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm dynamite, dynamite, dynamite
I'm dynamite, dynamite, dynamite
I can hold you in the morning but in the evening I gotta go
'Cause I'm on to the next girl and the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh
I got you caught up in the raps, yeah
Make you recap the feelings you had for your last boyfriend
Before he slapped ya, you never wanted someone so bad
Ya sweatin' but if I'm what you wanted
Why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You can't ignore it so don't just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that you
Couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
So stop with the store pick up line ups
Lets get the pineapple schnapps going
No one will knock as long as I hang a sign up sayin' 'Don't disturb'
Shawty, I'm so superb, I say the right things
Don't I speak the dopest words?
So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
I'm dynamite, dynamite, dynamite
I'm dynamite, dynamite, dynamite
I can hold you in the morning but in the evening I gotta go
'Cause I'm on to the next girl and the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh
So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she?  We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby
[Intro]
Look....if you had...one shot....one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted...in one moment
Would you capture it?...Or just let it slip? Yo..
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweety, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how? Everybody's choking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over BLOAH !
Snap back to reality, ohh, there goes gravity
Ohh there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo this whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Chorus]
You better, lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo...
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo...
[Verse 2]
My soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder 
It only grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on, dah dah dum, dah dum dum
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin',and step writing the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
fact that I can't get by with my nine to 
five and I can't provide the right type of
life for my family, 'cause man these Goddamn food stamps
Don't buy diapers, and it's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed plus, teetertotter
Caught up between being a father and a pre maddonna
Baby momma drama screamin' and it's too much for me, 
To wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotamy
Has gotten me, to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot, before I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom I love you but this trailer has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not cos
This may be the only opportunity that I got
[Chorus]
[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to man
Yeah, definitely, definitely, definitely dawg
Definitely, definitely k-mart
Yeah, yeah
You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw a line on any fences
If so to what extensive
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say that I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this
Far at other people's expenses
I say your all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship and it's down right blasphemous
Listen to shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Chirs-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed Superman
And how ironic? That I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite, the green chronic
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man
Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse and it's bi-sexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after preforming the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say, what's fair to say and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre?
(What up?)
I gotta question if I may?
(Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend
(Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off?
(Yeah)
But, ut! I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney but he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't mean to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
Till then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider senses telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and open up a whip ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where is the goddamn beat?
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon a
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and screw my
Head is straight back to the Neverland ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I don't gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is
Rain man
'Cause I
Yo, rain man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre, super dope beat maker
Two thousand and two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
And seventy
This is your Fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please, undo your seatbelt for takeoff
You are now free to smoke about the cabin
Dr.Dre: 
I'm Dre from back in the day from
NWA from black and the gray from
Choking a bitch to smacking her face from
Stacking up bodies to
Racking their kegs up
from Racking a bitch to 
Stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we was happening and rapping Entertainment
Me & Shady for us competition
Faggot, There ain't none
Eminem:
Speak of the devil
It's attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun run, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon?
No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon
A great one
Wait, it ain't funny man
It's urgent I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
We're now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
We're now smoking with the best (the best)
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless
A nice environment
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants
taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and vicadin
Before I begin to get so high; pussy boy, I could spin
Fin, fin
Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows of my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch, throw up, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse - if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
We're now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
We're now smoking with the best (the best)
Dr.Dre:
Now where's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where's there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games
Eminem:
Nah, uh he ain't playing
He's gonna get the AKA and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane
Vodka and creatine
Hypnotic and red bull
It's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings
I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl
You catch me, CSI
It's as easy as pie
And as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make them tremble and shake
Dr.Dre:
Now put your smoke up in the air
And raise your henny and coke
And if you really wanna get Fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it
You smoking with the triest and truest
I got the Midas touch
When it comes to rolling shit up
You MotherFuckers ain't smoking
You just holding Shit up
Now here we go
Let's get up, get down hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Cuz if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees
Eminem:
Well puffing ain't enough for me
Fuck yeah, light it up Cheech, come on
Smoke me out, cuz
Give me contact buzz
Get me on track
They love me when I'm on that stuff
But this earth calling Shady, man come on back (what?)
Man we're losing him; he won't even respond back (Fuck!)
Now look at all the pretty women in here
(Damn bitches)
Dre, it's hot
I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer
You get the bandages
Now baby just bend over 
This won't hurt a damn it justÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
We're now smoking with the best (the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
We're now smoking with the best (the best)
Torture chambers, secret passage ways,
vats of acid.... and deadly vaults.
Damn, it feels good to be back, like having a relapse.
How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
he's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem?
Well, to be honest, the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic,
they compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
tryna to stick my fuckin' dick inside a mannequins ass
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed,
Man, it's kick ass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masked men, it ain't to late to have a change of pace
and take it off and show my face so you can see the things you facin'
Slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation,
thats bacon souffle you making aint you, well thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma,
just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for it mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
shovin' the vacuum nozzle down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day I get a little flakier,
the medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that 18 month old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in 80 some places, baby, here shady comes lady
he's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chain-ch-saw baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dumb dumbs
yeah, here I come come, you hear the rumbling, vrum vrum
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum drum
a head and torso of someone, where'd it come from? Who's it belong to? 
Maybe that girl with the long blond hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms
Clearly theres some(thing) wrong 'cause she didn't come home
shes missing -- where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
now everybody get your dance on to my damn song
c'mon
[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what'd daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
Whatchu crying about?
You got me.
[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know u miss your mom
And I know u miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see your sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside you wanna cry
Cuz you're scared
I ain't there,
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin'
Wipe them tears
Daddy's here
No more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it
We gon' do it
Lainie's uncle's crazy ain't he, yeah
But he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins
When it swirls
When it whirls
When it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things, growin' up
As daddy, daddy had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way,
Your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being
Together ever again
Like we used to be like when we was teenagers
But then of course
Everything always happen for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something
We have no control over
And that's what destiny is
But no more worries
Rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up
And this will all just be a dream
[Chorus]
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Every thing's gonna be all right
Stiffin' that upper lip up little lady I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside, it may seem a little crazy
Pretty baby but I promise, Mama's gon' be alright
[Verse two]
It's funny,
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me,
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night crying
Cuz daddy felt like a bum,
See daddy had a job, but his job
Was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna to start a piggy bank for you
So you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
'Till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mamma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguing a lot
So mama moved back on to Chalmers in a flat
One bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me,
But daddy had to work, you and mama had to leave me,
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house,
Just reminiscing. Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainnie I'm talking to you too daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it
Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment
[Chorus]
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Every thing's gonna be all right
Stiffin' that upper lip up little lady I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside, it may seem a little crazy
Pretty baby but I promise, mama's gon' be alright
[End chorus]
And if you ask me to, daddy's gonna buy you a mocking bird
I'ma give you the world, I'ma buy a diamond ring for you,
I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck, I'll go back to the jeweler
Who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat
Don't fuck with Dad (ha ha)
Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
Never win but the battle wages on
We're toy soldiers
I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never 'sposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with the Benzino
It don't matter I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy somethin' I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
And that was just out of respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, now I'm talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand
This is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
I'm still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute, because
Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
Never win but the battle wages on
We're toy soldiers
There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck him, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it, has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder INC
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryin' to have none of people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all, 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws well then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause
Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
Never win but the battle wages on
We're toy soldiers
(Stan:)
Dear eminem is your mother is a slob or do you have to see me in public...
         (50 Cent)
Ooh,now she's scared.now shes scared because i didnt let you know--(WHAT?!) oh now shes putting the ----- on me do you think i have to-----on you??!!!!
          (Jeff Bass)
D12 beat me up in the bathroom but do you---or do i have to pull this out and end my misery??! or do i have to---
(Go left, go left, go left right left)
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
You feel weak and when you feel weak
  (Go left, go left, go left right left)
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
(Go left, go left, go left right left)
You gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
  (Go left, go left, go left right left)
And not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' them
'Cause when I am not then I am stop pinnin' them
And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sendin' them
Women are caught in webs, spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of Penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxacilin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killin' hip hop fillin' minimal swap
To cop millions of pac listeners
Your comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzin' up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You pizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
(Until the roof, until the roof)
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
(The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs, until my legs)
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
(Give out from underneath me)
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Music is like magic there's a certain feelin' you get
When your real and you spit and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment and every sin'le minute you spend
Tryin' to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when its at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothin's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The presses wet dream like Bobby and Whitney Nate hit me
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
(Until the roof, until the roof)
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
(The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs, until my legs)
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
(Give out from underneath me)
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Soon as a verse starts, I eat it at MC's heart
What is he thinkin'? I'ma not to go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bump some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin' at them
The track is on some battlin' raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
(Until the roof, until the roof)
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
(The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs, until my legs)
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
(Give out from underneath me)
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
(Until the roof)
Until the roof
(The roof comes off)
The roof comes off
(Until my legs)
Until my legs
(Give out from)
Underneath me
I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me
[Intro- talking]
{Eminem]
Shady, Aftermath
(BTOV) {nate dogg]

There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control
hey hey Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Creek
[Bobby Creek]
I'm on the patron
In the end I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear
I'm gone
So she hear me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone
Cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta
So southern ain't just part of my grammar
I can up and cock the hammer
For any nigga wid Hammer
But I came here to get on goose and tropicana
Get loose put some more of my juice
In your caboose
Sippin everything from white grain
To deuce juice
With nothin' to gain
But my grace and loose tooths
Eminem came Obie stat and proof too
Bobby creek is in the place
The name is snoop too
But they might been around
My drinks is 10 around
I can make her spin around
If she keep her dinner down
Simmer down
We can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I'll let you in ya work
Come sip on my gum drops
yeah
[Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
We bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin for a girl
That will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up
[Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
[Eminem]
O' Trice!
[Obie Trice]
One slug
Couldn't snuff young 'cause
Goodness gracious
Haters stay on his nuts
One just like a hood rat chick who was curious
Serious
Full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the cool blue back
With a blue new rag
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch
Its true that I had a few
Obie rollin' with brews
aint that annual annually knockin' the boots
It's on manual
The way I knock em outta they shoes
Talk a little shit
Then they anus'll ooze
Talk a little spit on my ding-a-lang
Who
It's shady
You know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you
In the mansion
With a magnum
With a night came to the matinee
mad as ?? 
Obie
Came to party
You better ask somebody
[Nate Dogg- Chorus]
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me,
Shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me,
Shaddy
There's no escaping
There's no place to hide
You scream 'Someone save me'
But they don't pay no mind, goodbye
You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin' and your in a
Nightmare it's horrible
Right there's the coroner
Waitin' for you to turn the corner
So he can corner ya', you're a goner
He's on to ya', out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run, all you want is to rest
'Cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowing the Calotapin
While I'm nodding in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn holding onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it, wake up naked
At McDonald's with blood all over me
Dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again, not again
It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em
(Killed 'em)
Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon, I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanolin
Bust all over the wall paneling
Dismantling every candle on top
Of the fire place mantle and grab my flannel
And my bandanna then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standing in my front window
If you look in, I'm just a hooligan who's used to
Using hallucinogens, causing illusions again
Brain contusions again, vutting and bruising the skin
Razors, scissors, and pins, Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through, dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who, gave these molecules to me
What am I gonna do? Hey, the prodigal son
The godfather for one
Very methodical when I slaughter them
It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em
(Killed 'em)
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
I cut and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of a Jack
My last vic and a half, a flashlight up
Kim Kardashian's ass, I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member, December
I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinking tub
Cut him up into pieces and just
When I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta' drink his bathwater that oughta' be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man
There's got to be one, oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up
(Up)
It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em
(Killed 'em)
Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wantedÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip? 
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up over, blow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water his bosses don't want him no mo, he's cold product they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He knows dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
No more games, i'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothaf**kin roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no mekhi phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screamin on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothaf**kin option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
I cannot grow old in salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
(Eminem)
I really liked you
and you didnt listen
and now I wanan take back everything I said
I wish I were dead
to many things that I did
To many wrongs that i've done
how could I be so stupid
not thinkin of anyone else
just thinkin about me
(chorus)
If you think a while
you will fine out that no one in this world of ours
is perfect
(Eminem)
I shoulda been thinkin about the others around me
who I would be hurtin
who I made mad
who i made sad
I just wish I could take it all back
even at the cost of my lyrics
cant bare it
I need you
Im nothing without you
Im scared of life
I need someone by my side
i dont wanna just sit and hide
(Chorus)
If you think a while
you will fine out that no one in this world of ours
is perfect
Im tired of life
and its bad ride
everyone thats died in Iraq
when the United States were under attack
all the terorism goin on
everyone that been hit by a bomb
(Chorus)(X2)
If you think a while
you will fine out that no one in this world of ours
is perfect.
Men singing:
Jealous! (8X)
[Girls voice: (Talking over the singing)]
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...
[Verse 1:]
I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me 
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?
[Chorus: Men Singing]
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (8X)
[Women's Voice: (Talking over singing)]
Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy
[Verse 2:]
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like 
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga** 
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
He goes, "You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"
Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...
[Chorus: Men Singing]
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (12X)
Ah yeah, yo!
This song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope without a circus net
I'm popping perkasets, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
'Bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged, full of venom and rage
Especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, that's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders
These overnight stars becoming autograph signers
We'll all goin' to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fry's and average half pinter's
While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hoping things will look up but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die we know were all going the same way
It's cool to be player but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man plus a luxury sedan
Too comfortable and roomy in a six
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Walk around depressed and smoke a pound of ses a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I'll end up burning in Hell scorching in flames
That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
Just lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems, now everybody on my blocks got 'em
I'm screaming like those two cops when Tupac shot 'em
Holding two Glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I never went gold of one song
I'm running up on someone's lawns with guns drawn
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
A shimmy shimmy go go motherfuckin' pop
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips
I get all the money, pussy falls like rain
Been gettin' laid and paid, that's why I never complain
If I ain't in it for the money, I'm in it for the P
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me
You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye
Fuckin' with my 2-5 up your fuckin' ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we wanna do
We're fuckin' up your city and we're fuckin' up your program
Fuckin' all your bitches, we can fuckin' give a goddamn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence
Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fuckin' planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakin'
So I'm gonna get what I got coming and the rest I'm takin'
I'm shakin' like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like a motherfucker's brand new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit givin' my heart and soul
Been shinin' like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal
So fuck off
Shit
With my pants half hangin' off my ass and shit
Bowl filled with hash, pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom trippin' sippin' shots of Jack
'Cause the kids don't listen gettin' lots of flack
I be the do wa diddy up and down you block
And the 10 Karat Kid with my triggers cockin'
The K, the I the D R O C K, motherfucker
And you still don't know me
So blow me bitch, I don't rock for cancer
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like Senna in the Indy 5
And get live with that which gets me high
Strive for perfection, this much is true
We do what we say, you say what we do
Kid Rock, I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get to much P to ever be no homo
Rock from Soho to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust, it ain't God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan, I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Carey couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast
Fuck off
Yeah, right in your motherfuckin' ass bitch
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit switched we're on the same script
Nothing new since '76, Kid Rock
Yo Slim Shady, come break these motherfuckers off
Yo tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathing the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise
Slim Shady and Brown Trucker, another bunch of mother fuckers
Who hate the world as much as each other
And I ain't leaving this party tonight
Till I see some naked bitches dancin' around, drunk, touchin' each other
Rum and Pepsi got your perception of me sketchy
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms
'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules, people that straight fool
And ever single teenager that hates school
Fuck off
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash whiskey and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me you'll get in imagine this
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to interscope?
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
Pissy drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo)
That's what I said at my dad's funeral
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit he gets killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill
We don't do drivebys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with them too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibres here
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year
'Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen when a thousand bullets
Come at your house and collapse the foundation around you
And they found you and your family in it
God-damnit he meant it when he tells you
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville

Peace to Thirstin Howl, A. L., and 
Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack I had a 
premature birth
I'm just a nerve cursed with badly 
disturbed nerves
You wanna be the one to step up 
and get served first
99% of aliens prefer
earth
I come here to rule the planet, 
starting with your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a 
word search
With smeared letters runnin' 
together in blurred spurts
I hang with male chauvinist pigs
and perverts
Who point water pistols at women
and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and 
Gerber's
My first words were bleep bleep and 
curse curse
Never had it and I still don't 
deserve dirt
My breath still stinks and I'm on 
my third cert
Yanking out my stitches, and hollering "nurse nurse,
You said this shot would numb it, 
chick it just hurts worse!"
 
Slim Shady
Cali Kings
Venga Boys
Nah man
Not quite finished yet
Girl I think,
You just might'a tried to pull a muh'fucking fast one, I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling, and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games?
See this saw blade? See the silhouette of a stalker
in your walk-way? Better co-operate
Or get saute'd and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet you can hear a muh'fucking dog whistle while I walk by
'Colt Seavers' on a mule, stuntin on that ass like the fucking Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes at the mit, man I treat it like a Mogwai
Cuz it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids, women and men
Vrinn-vrinn! Motor's so big you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits while you're cringin'
Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
While I spin spin even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny?
Shiit, if I think a penny's pretty
just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie meenie miney mo, Catch an eskimo by his toe
While he's trying to roll a snowball but,
Don't make him lose his cool
If he hollers better let him go ya'll
Now here we go go goooooo
Get up! Baby get a move on, Like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You will never think of this shit
Yeah, honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I reek it
Evil I see, hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady
Fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every muh'fucking chicken fore' it hatches
Cuz, you can bet your ass that we gone get it crackin'
Like a Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in so bad
You gone have Kurt Kobain askin
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
I'm fashionable and 'bout as rational
as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it
Don't stand there and look stupid at me bitch
I ain't in the mood for this shit
Get my kit, Google it till it pops up
Ya'll are so motherfucking full of shit that you're stopped up
Me I'm always shitting diarrhea of the mouth
Till your speakers crap out [fart] "Ohp, What?"
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette "Chik-Chigarette"
But you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut! Because..
Here we go go goooooo
And now that I got your panties in a bunch
and your bowels in an uproar
Im'ma show you why I kang xi
Stop asking me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore know you want more,
bitches tell I put the Mat back into Mathers
Cuz I'm a fucking problem, Run boy!
Every flow got it mastered
So every last word that you fucking fags heard
comes straight from the fishes ass, Yeah
In other words I'm a Bass turd!
Looking at me like I killed Kenny
Gassing the tank near steal plenty
No morals are instilled in me
So remorse I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal
Understandable why you're jealous, fucking animal
I got cannibal magnetism, cant resist him now, can ya hoe?
Shady, I don't understand your flow.
Understand my flow?
Bitch I flow like Troy Palumalu's hair, boy.
Don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy.
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare
stay the fuck outta my hair, boy!
You can look, you can stare and point
But you can't touch since you're queer boy.
I don't get it man, is there a void
All this weak shit, what am I steroids?
Well bitch I'm back with some shit for that ass
and your trunk, Elephant hemorrhoids
And remember boys
Here we go go goooooo
Thank you for coming out
Hope you enjoyed the show
Till next time
haha
Peace!

ANDR3, THINK IT'S FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE.
ANDR3: YAH, CANT BELIEVE ALL THIS BULLSHIT.
PITBULL: FUCK THE CUNTS, PUT IT IN YOUR BREAST FUCK.
Eminem: YAH, FUCK YOU!
Shady
We're back
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
And you better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no name brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or damn get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best
I'm nowhere thought up as that, not even the same league
As Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
The name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
Yo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radio
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And they very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which is amaze me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big b-b-big b-b-baby
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin' to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes gets better each day
Replay my relay race
When I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so
Shady
Stat Quo, we're back
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs c'mon
I treat the mic like the block, fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves sure was a breeze
I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "Suck my dick" I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail he
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'ma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon' tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady
Shady
Bobby Creek, we're back
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with 'em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track
Nigga
Shady
Cashis
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death lived in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'ma see
Or have you raped in the pen like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back, nigga
Shady
Ha! I told you we was back
We're back
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There ya' go
Yeah, yo', yo'
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have
I've been protested and demonstrated
Against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes
Look at the times, sick is the mind of the
Motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one
Give 'em hell long as I'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin',
An' takin' names in the
Evenin', leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me but
They'll never figure me out, look at me now
I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you Mama?
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry Mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, "I'm sorry Mama", I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to seventy three
Before I ever had a multi platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work with her
At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun
'Cause Id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show'
I'm sorry Mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, "I'm sorry Mama", I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own Mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
Your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin'
Through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems
Victim of MÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¼nchhausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick
When I wasn't 'til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma
But guess what, your gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
(Ha ha)
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be
I'm sorry Mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, "I'm sorry Mama", I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ohh!
Yeah!
So much for first single on this one
[Verse 1] 
Shady's the lable 
Aftermath is the stable 
That the horses come out erra 
Of course we're about to stir up 
Some shit thick as Mrs. Butterworth's syrup 
It's the mr. pick on Christopher Reeves Just for no reason 
other than the just to tease him 
Cause he was his biggest (burp) fan He used to be Superman 
Now we're pourin liquor on the curb in his name for him 
Eminem you wait till' we meet up again 
Fucker I'm kickin your ass for everything you've ever said 
It goes one for the money two for the fuckin show 
Ready get set, let's go 
Here comes the buckin bronco 
stompin and stampedin up the damn street Like them buffalo soldiers, I told ya I'm bout' to blow 
So look out below, geronimo, motherfuckers is dominos 
I'm on a roll, around and around I go 
When will I stop? I don't know 
Tryna pick up where the Eminem Show left off But I know 
anything's possible 
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold 
I'm at the top of my game 
That shit is not gonna change 
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team 
I'll get away with murder Im like OJ, He's my Cochran today 
We keep them Mark Ferman tapes 
In a safe, locked them away 
Better watch what you say 
Just when you thought you were safe 
Them fuckers got you on tape 
You swear to god you was playin 
Whether or not you was little Joshua 
Gosh I wish I coulda told you to not do the same 
Cause one day it could cost you your name 
[chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up so,
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle
smack a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh No
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Ah
erra Oh Oh Ah Ah
oh ah
erra OH ah
erra oh ah
erra
Poo Poo Ca Ca
[Verse 2] 
Erra Erra Eric swallowed some generic sleeping pills 
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derick bare naked 
chicka chicka chicka .. 
Jenna just turned 16 and used a fake id 
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly 
Hehehehehe, to be so young and naive 
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free 
Paris and Nikki's parents must be so tickled to cherish 
Every picture with their kids 
with hickeys all over their necks 
Hickory Dickory derr digga 
Look at me work wizardry with these words 
Am I a jerk or just jerk chicken 
Or Chicka chicka chicka chicka jer jer jerkin the chain 
22 jerks and a jerk circle 
Or is it a circle jerkle wait a minute

Am I just jerkin the chain 
Am I bizerk or insane 
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs 
Workin the damn camera filmin one of them 
Paris Hilton home made pornos 
Who keeps tiltin the lens at an angle 
Chicka Chicka 
Just recently somebody just discovered 
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fuckin 
When they were just mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse club 
And dusted them and went straight to The Source with them 
Cause they coulda sworn someone said Nuh- 
And then tried to erase and record over it 
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the 
Cuh Uh and then the come-to-find-out-it-was-Justin 
Sayin "I'm Go-nna
Cum" and this was
[chorus]
supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up so,
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a hoe
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle

[Verse 3] 
Any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest 
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it 
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number 
It's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick 
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me 
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key 
And I'll be sure to get back As soon as there comes a day 
that I fall out with Dre 
Wake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!) 
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, 
Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock(?) bawka-bi-kawk 
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick 
And stick a dick in your mouth 
I'm done you can fuck off 
fucka-fucka-fuck offf! 
[chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up so,
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle

This is a public service announcement brought to you in part by Slim Shady
The views and events expressed here are totally fucked
And are not necessarily the views of anyone
However the events and suggestions that appear on this album
Are not to be taken lightly, children should not partake in the listening
Of this album with laces in their shoes
Slim Shady is not responsible for your actions
Upon purchasing this album you have agreed
Not to try this at home
An' anything else?
Yeah, don't do drugs
The Wild Gotham
The Wild  West
Ha ha, ride
All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old 45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin' the truth, I got a price on my head too
'Cause when you
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
He was 'Shady', I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit, went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(You need bullets, hurry up run)
I put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin' the truth that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
The Chronic
(Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(And plus I know who's got it)
Who?
(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
(Dre here's the plot)
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin' around sayin' he took the game from us
(Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin')
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a 'G Thang'
And a verse from 'Keep Their Heads Ringin''
I said, "It's Dre's Day", and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
Always die
The Wild Gotham
The Wild West
Ha ha, ride
*Yawns*
Yeah, look
If I were to rap about the crap that's out 
That's the route you probably want me to take
'Cause you're just dying to know what I think 
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants 'cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like, my competition I mean, right?
Nope, Paul Wall is dope and so is Bubba 
So, bluhhh, pfft
B-b-b-but....
I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard do the rope a dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents do donuts
Sometimes I play possum like I'm asleep it's awesome!
I'm like a sleeping giant and when I awake I'm like Dre 
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em fulla poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E the Eminem em-belem
I always thought if you're gonna murder somebody you should face 'em
Tell 'em why look 'em dead in the eye then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell 
And swallow the shallow the hollow who dwell 
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls 
For this rap game and it ga ga goes.
123 check, check 123, check 123
That ain't the hook now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say 
My public adores me!
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror glows lips and it whispers come nearer
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I can not have you, no one can you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart, and your body
I don't want you to ever leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I can not have you, no one can you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart, and your body
Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, 
Come here, talk to me sit here, pull up a chair, 
Why don't you cut your hair? 
Hahaha
Dye it back, come on try it
Ah no, I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
But I'm here to re-build you 
But I already killed you!
But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother
Yeah, so what of her?
Well, think about what she did to you and your little brother!
All them foster homes!
Fuck you, motherfucker! 
I had you beat! 
No, I was playin' possum 
'Member, I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine 
I'm taking it back!
You fucking bitch! Why?
Because I love you, look a little closer... 
Isn't that us on that poster? 
Hahaha
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I can not have you, no one can you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart, and your body
I don't want you to ever leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I can not have you, no one can you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart, and your body
Shady, listen (SHADY) you hear that? 
They're screaming for you, 
I can bring you career back!
But I don't want it back
Yes you do!
No I don't! 
Yes you do! You're gonna regret it later 
No I wont!
I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the doctor
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday 
Well I got him on the phone right now 
Slim?
You're lying 
Yo, Slim? 
How? Why now? 
What up Dre? 
Check this out, Slim, I gotta talk to you
I dunno 
It just seems like ever since you got off your drugs 
You became a lot softer!
But Dre, all Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka!
Well, just think about it, Slim, I'm here!
Just hit me back and let me know what's up
Fuck this mirror! Ah!
I'm not in the mirror 
I'm inside you, let me guide you!
Fuck you! Die you son of a bitch!
Put the gun down! 
Bye bye!
(gunshot)
Okay, I'm still alive! 
So am I too! 
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried too, haha
You sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal 
Well, Dre signed you!
This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right whoo?
Look at this house! 
Look at these cars! 
Oh so nice, whoo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you're just now seeing the down side to!
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too!
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall? 
WHAT!
No one's gonna love you like I do!
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I can not have you, no one can you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart, and your body
And I don't want you to ever leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I can not have you, no one can you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart, and your body.
I said, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I can not have you, no one can you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heat, and your body.
Thats why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
Thats why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
Thats why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
Thats why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
I murder a rhyme one word at a time, you never
Heard of a mind as perverted as mine, you better
Get rid of that nine it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, thankful is jail
I used to be my mommy's little Angel at twelve
At thirteen I was putting shells in the gage on the shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Till I cut a kitten's head off
And stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey! mom! mom!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of sucess? It sucks too much press
And stress, too much zest, and breasts, too upset
It's just, too much mess, I guess
I must just blew up quick, yes
Grew up quick? No
Was raised right?
Whatever you say is wrong
Whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say "Hi"
Became a commodity because I'm W H I T E
'Cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'till Kim sees me
Now is it worth it?  Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips bitch, what?  My mouth isn't working?
You read this finger?  Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back , I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
I take each individual degenerate, his head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
My name is Slim Shady
I've been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational
Back, it's the incredible
With Ken Kaniff who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff, on the internet
Tryin' to lure your kids, with him, into bed
It's a sick world we're livin' in these days
Slim, for pete's sake, put down Christopher Reeve's legs
Geez! you guys are so sensitive
Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it
Mind with no sense in it, fried, gets so frantic
'Cause eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin' lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin' out
All high and dosin' it
And that's where I get my name from
That's why they call me
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
I take seven kids from columbine and stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A MAC-11 and this oughtta solve this problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all of the time
'Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy as this world was
Over this whole Y2K thing, and by the way
N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip-sync and buy a bigger size of ear rings?
That's why I tend to block out when I hear things
'Cause all these fans screamin' is making my ears ring
So I just throw up the middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this
Sorry Puff but I don't give a fuck, if this chick was my own mother
I'd still fuck her with no rubber, and come inside her
And have a son and a new brother
At the same time, and just say that it ain't mine
What's my name?
I am
Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
That's why
They call me Slim Shady
I'm back, I'm back
Guess who's back?
Gue-gue-guess who's back?
Hi mom
Guess who's back?
Gue-gue-guess who's back?
D12
Dr Dre
Slim Shady
2001
I'm blew out from this blunt
Fuck
Well, I do pop pills
I keep my tube socks filled
And pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hos
Like a soap opera episode
Then punch a bitch in the nose
Until her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: Girls, women, and bitches
I'm that vicious to talk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me "Boogie Night"
A stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Coming through the airport sluggish, walking on crutches
And hit a pregnant bitch in the stomach with luggage
It's like a dream, I can't back out, I black out
I'm back out, looking for someone "of" to beat
the "crap out"
I'm bringing you rap singers
Two middle fingers
Flip you off in French and translate it in English
Then I'm gonna vanish from the face of this planet
And come back speaking so much Spanish that Pun can't even understand it
[Intro]
What we have to do is deal with it when these idividuals are young enough. If you wish to be saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or which over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better.
[Verse 1- Eminem] 
Come on, let's cut the bullshit enough 
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up 
Let's take this shit back to bassment 
And we can disscuss statements thats made on this tape 
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love 
The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy 
Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit 
Crossin 8 Mile in the warnin and hit territory 
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and cant no body tell it for me 
You will well inform me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side a day that I might slide
You may call it a past I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious oh well known tracks
[Chorus x2]
Come on lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
[Verse 2- Eminem] 
I'd roam the streets so much they call me a drifter 
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike 
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and van dike 
And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard 
And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark 
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Schaumers after dark 
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's 
That's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps 
where I's born handin out some flyers, he was doin some talent shows 
At Center Line High, I told him to stop by and check us out sometime 
He looked at me like I'm out my mind, shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit with compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
[Chorus x2]
Come on lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
[Verse 3- Eminem] 
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school 
It was cool till your man MC Shan came through 
And said that Puma was the brand 'cause the clan makes Troops 
It was rumors but man god damned they flew 
Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes 
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too
And we just threw them in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X Clan debut
Professor X and glorious exists in a state of red, black, and green
With a key sissies now with this bein a new trend
We don't fit in crackas is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butter would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showin 'em off not knowin at all
We was bein laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flav clock we gon' have to snatch that
All I remember is meetin back at Manix's basement
Sayin how we hate this, how racist but dope the X Clan tape is
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool 'cause I rapped so she was kinda eyein me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gon' say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
I was wrong 'cause no matter what color a girl is she still a [whore?]
[Chorus x2]
Come on lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
THAT WAS THE WORST YOUR A FUCKING MORON HERE IS HOW THE SONG GOES
Eminem:
S-S-Shady Records, you better believe the HYPE is real...
'Yeah! Yeah! Shots to Soul Assasins! DJ MUGZ... Alchemist...
Chorus: 
Niggas know what i'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause i don't have to
You can run your own mouth, i don't care
If you get too close i'm gon' clap you
it's too real out here, to be scared
A real nigga gon' do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
it aint considered a crim unless they catch you
We all die 1 day...
Obie Trice:
Niggas, when i step up in the bar, faggots's wanna look
Like you muthafuckas got Obie Trice shook
Like i'ma stand here as a man
and let some queer-ass funny lookin nigga get the upper hand
I got issues... got no time
Got guns than more niggas moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas rides
Everybody runnin' for they muthafuckin lives
Tough Club niggas? we leave early
Cock back shirley, open up ya fade
your gray brain needs motor city paid
Your nervous system still twitch on days; these
ho's and animals ?'s get merked
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
don't ever let a nigga tell you 'play the ball hard'
Trust in God 'cause you's about to have a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
a .45 that'll lite niggas up
and this .45 high make me not give a fuck
Chorus:
Lloyd Banks:
But as long as i'm here i'm gon' grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make ya ass bet
My words touch niggas in jail, make them wanna finish they last bet
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
if thats the case, then get a bigger one
You dont think i pack the 'bump' 'cause i'm out the hood
that's a stereotype, like everybody that's black can jump
i'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic and them
I'm out in dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish i'm established 'til the cabbage'll come
I'm in the clouds, you don't see me on a train
I travel first class, you aint ever got a TV on your plane
ssh, be easy on my name
'cause i aint goin bank n forth
your boss and ya captains's soft
Chorus:
Eminem:
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gon' get it
Man when we gon' hit 'em
chew 'em up and spit 'em out
 too much venom
and if you roll wit em
we gon' fuck you up wit 'em
i got too much momentum
movin in my direction to lose
my shoes'll explode as soon as you go to step in 'em *BOOM!*
You know how we do it when we do how we do it
and we come through, g-unit d one two (D12) and Obie we all move
like assasins, ski masks and gloves
consider this as a warning, disaster comes
faster than you can react to it, just ask Marx
we are fizzast, fuck your little bitch as up
We are not killas, my vato will have you shot though
drag the little body on fuck like kim osario's
little sorry-o ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source coovers like fuckin Cyrpress Hill
then in the Ninties when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, i don't smoke, but i toke
enough second hand to make my fuckin P.O. choke
I'm an O.G. you're fuckin wit a G.I. Joe
BIA BIA, MIA-MIA you livin la vida a loc?
i'm a psyhco, mariah aint got shit on me
when i retire i'll be spittin baby food on peep-
le it at San Ceedrow Ranch huddled up next to a em with hello kitty on slippers on humpin her 
legs

I'll put my blade in you like a fuckin pin cushin
slice your ear clear off, Schmirnoff and Hen dawg (hennessy)
I'll show you how to fuckin kill a man like Sin-dog
Nobody told you that i'm loco esse?

I'm Slim Sha.. DY and the D's for dees nuts
and you can get each one for free so feast up
i pee in a cup for 3 months, i'm having a E party
for easter, please come
50 Cent:
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gon' get it
your name up over him, chew him up
and spit him out 
too much venom
and if you roll wit' him we gon' fuck you up wit' him
you can do all them push ups to pump up ya chest
i got a 12 gauge Marksberg to pump up ya chest
have you gaspin for air after that shell hit ya vest
fear me like you fear God 'cause i bring death
silver back gorilla in the concrete jungle
i'm the strongest around, you know how i get down
i watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
turn it off before it ends because the bad guy dies
if you tryin' to buy guns from the nigga that look to
so what they got bodies on 'em they still look new
you can raise your voice like you finna touch somethin'
when i raise my knife, shit i'm finna cut somethin
they say i walk like Ron O'neil and talk like obie (obie trice)
if the bitch think i love her, well then the bitch don't know me
haha, sorry KIM (eminem's ex wife)
You don't see me in the hood
It's 'cause I'm doing this man
Niggas, I'm still grinding
(Yeah)
I'm still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's mine and my mic's on
And my time is none because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak until these hoes feel this
(For sure)
And I can't let y'all derail me man
I got young Kobe, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
'Cause Obie be back
(Ain't goin' nowhere man)
We got them craps going on and that yak going on
Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin'
It's whateva, put that on the chedda man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Lovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out
This is it my nigga, this what we boast about
Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin' mouth
And show me love bitch
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
(I don't love you bitch)
I wanna hold you in the morning
(Ha)
Hold you through the night
(Ha ha ha)
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
(We wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns)
I wanna hold you in the morning
(We wanna love money)
Hold you through the night
(Ha, we don't wanna love bitches though)
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamamie
You just ain't Zane enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole 'Kit and Kaboodle'
I'm just brutal, it's no rumor, I'm numero-uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me bitch
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
Hold you through the night
(And all the bitches say)
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
Hold you through the night
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow
It's about the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too
I roll like a bus, 9-11 pulse same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gonna front, I thought R-Kelly was tha shit
Then we find out he fucking round with bow wow bitch
Niggas eatin' popcorn, right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty momma in the precinct hollerin' rape
I'm convinced man something really wrong with these hoes
I thought Lil' Kim was hot then she start fucking with her nose
(Goddamn)
Used to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD that didn't have no beats
(Uh, huh)
That boy D'Angelo he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charlie B'more to deep throat
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
(I love the burners, the monies, the bunnies)
Hold you through the night
(I just wanna hold you)
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
(I just wanna love you)
Hold you through the night
(Yeah)
[Intro]
Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging
[Verse]
I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
That's what he says to himself
As he uses magazines to trash me
As he sits with both feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
Cuz he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared
[Chorus]
You aint no motherfucking (bully)
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, aint gon coward to no (bully)
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)
[Verse]
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many motherfuckers that just are
They just keep pounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja' [laughter]
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv's on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
I dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull a race card
And it backfires in your face hard
Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist that you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch
[Chorus]
You must be taking to much (E...)
[Verse]
Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs, Slang Toungue, and Freaky Ta
It's like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
I'm not excluding myself
Cuz I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Halie's name
[Chorus]
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)
[Spoken]
Get at me, dawg
Holla

Women Singing: 
Ain't no one special  special like you (4X) 
I been searching  but your the one I want in my life baby (4X) 
Verse 1: Eminem 
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing 
Missing what I remember  kissing and hugging and squeezing 
Bugging and weezing  I'm having trouble when breathing 
It's even tougher when sleeping 
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving 
For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening 
You got my knees buckling and weakening 
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in 
And interrupt when I'm speaking 
I got some game that I'm preparing to run 
The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun 
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun 
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun 
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a 
touch 
I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good 
The seed is passing in dust 
I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately 
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me 
If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby) 
Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be 
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed 
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led 
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found 
Chorus: 
Women Singing: 
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (4X) 
Verse 2: Denaun Porter 
Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo 
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through 
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast 
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es 
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne 
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on 
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things 
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane 
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day 
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray 
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear 
You look impeccable, nothing compares 
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so 
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so 
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is 
When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie 
Chorus: 
Women Singing: 
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (8X) 
Ain't no one special, special like you (2X) 
Everybody says they want a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
My account dosen't go that high
It doesn't mean you have to sat goodbye to me
Can't promise you a million bucks
But I can promise I'll be good to you
Everybody wants a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
Day one we'd go fishing
Dollar movies on day two
Days three and four we'd spend in bed
Just like we used to
A million days with you
Would go by much too fast
But I've got a million ways for our friendship to last
I've got a million ways
Everybody says they want a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
My account dosen't go that high
It doesn't mean you have to sat goodbye to me
Day five we would ride our bikes
Camping on day six
Days seven and eight I'd show you how much I love you
A million days with you
Would go by much too fast
But I've got a million ways for our friendship to last
I've got a million ways
Everybody says they want a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
My account dosen't go that high
It doesn't mean you have to sat goodbye to me
Can't promise you a million bucks
But I can promise I'll be good to you
Everybody wants a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
A billion days with you
A billion days with you

Hey yo  what's up man? Hey  yo you been here all day man 
Ya'll been here every weekend man  
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man! 
That's cause you whack! 
What?!? I ain't whack nigga  I got some raps for all ya'll 
Nigga my raps fresh  I'ma bust my raps first

You always rap first,

Thyme: 
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
Point him out man I wanna know 
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know 
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
Point him out bitch I wanna know 
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know 
Verse 1: Eminem 
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice 
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes 
Jacking life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan 
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband 
A stomped your man so unless you want what he got 
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot 
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask 
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask 
It's an amazing task to battle with success 
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less 
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians 
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions 
Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you 
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra 
So feel the force of my spiritual images 
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages 
My skin itches every time a rapper recites 
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites 
You wanna see fights I got a match for you 
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula 
Chorus: Thyme 
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
Point him out man I wanna know 
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?

Point him out bitch I wanna know 
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know 
Verse 2: Eminem 
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me 
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me 
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier 
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria 
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see 
How much in fear when u hear me you'll be 
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake 
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break 
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake 
I'll twist you into a different shape 
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake 
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake 
Every dis you can take, personal 
We ain't friends trying to make amends 
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence 
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces 
Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason 
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic 
So pass it like a hot potato 
I've never been less than clever and fresh 
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess 
Chorus: Thyme 
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
Point him out man I wanna know 
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know 
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man and said that you can flow? 
Point him out bitch I wanna know 
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow? 
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know 
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
Point him out!! I wanna know 
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know 
Ayo let me get that mic manÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ 
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow? 
Who the fuck passed you the mic, who the fuck passed you the mic!! 
I got the rhymes bitch, I'll kick that shit 
[DJ scratching] - "Do it!" 
[Eminem] 
Sneakin in through the back door, fruity MC's get ambushed 
Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed 
Then I'm movin on down from the right to left 
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death 
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two 
Smackin through 'til youre black and blue for actin true 
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands 
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans 
I'm stompin, I'm kickin, I'm chokin, I'm stampin em 
clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em 
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts 
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts 
I'm zappin, rappers, singers, and dancers 
Faster than you could snap your figures for ransom 
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin 
Survivin by connivin and theivin 
[DJ scratching] - "Do it!", "Eat em up" 
[Eminem] 
I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters 
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders 
Developin a fear of biterphobia 
I'm holdin a gas can and lighter over ya 
If I detect ya, I'ma pulverize 
Dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies 
And I'ma torture, with material iller 
than a stark ravin mad serial killer 
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is 
A major risk to a plagiarist 
So beware of the aura, A terror for the horrible 
Will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers 
Hit the source to better my skills, 
I head for the border 
And run the Galloping Hills, the choice is yours 
Cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse 
Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage yours to bite like labradors 
In the range of my double-barrel 
And your life is in danger, trouble, and peril 
[DJ scratching] 
[Eminem] 
I trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires 
'cause vampires right on my balls and clamp pliers 
And swing on my big thingamajig 
So I'm bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig 
Cause biters are fallin head over heels 
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels 
That's how I became paranoid 
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed 
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate 
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with 
an ultimatum I assault and slayed em 
with rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em 
Energetic and imaginative, 
pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives 
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10 
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen 
[DJ scratching] - "Everybody walk out the back door" 
[DJ scratching to fade]
Family Problems
[Royal Flush]
She was sweetest young thing in this life
Had two kids and worked nights, never had shit, but we ate right
And slept tight, my daddy's livin the bad life
Used to come home nights and beat on his wife
I was too young to really understand about life
Used to cry a lot, hopin that my father get shot
Plus he sniff a lot (What that nigga beef about every fuckin day?)
My brother said something got to make him stop
'cause mommy go to hard for every little thing we got
It was a stress and pain, had a young child, goin insane
Until one day, he slapped my brother right in the face
And my mother started running all over the place
I went downstairs and grab the nine from the safe
Went back upstairs and put the shit right in his face
What up now daddy, I shot him in the face and smiled loud
Now her body froze, lookin at my father die slow
She can't believe it though, started screamin baby don't go
He said two words, and breath went dead and blood fled
My face turned red, couldn't understand what I did
Brother scared as shit, losin my mind, my moms flip
Tears from my eye drip, I grabbed her tightly and kissed
I said we miss him, but no longer do we go thru this shit
So when the cops come, I'm the one that let off the gun
Only thing I'm askin, when I get a visit, you come
Tell my brother 'bout the story, right now, he too young
'cause he can't figure out the things that we've been through
The lifestyles that's goin on now, life is so wild
Check, check 1, 2, 1, 2 1, 2, it's rolling
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dr. Dre up in here y'all know what this is
It's what y'all been waiting for funk master Flex, Big Kap
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby
Yo, Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is, baby
I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it ain't latching and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation? Come on
Anyway I got down with Dre, what up?
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the police"
When you still had your mother's fucking nipple stuck in your teeth
Fucking baby, became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holla, "Bravo"
Hell yeah, I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't
'Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
Wanna fight?
I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady
Dr Dre
I'm drunk pass the tec
'Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
'Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake, don't get so bent out of shape
'Cause I went out and raped six girl friends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove, hello, where you at?
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you, lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change 'cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do
[Intro]
([Jay-Z]Best rapper alive) x4
[Jay-Z] Whoo!...Ladies and gentlemen... 
[Eminem] You're now about to witness the power of...
[Jay-Z] H, to the Izzo... and...
[Eminem] Shady (ha-ha)... It's showtime
[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
Yo, gather round hustlers that's if you still livin
And get on down, to that ol' Jig rhythm
Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison
A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high
I, Young 'Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers I'm back motherfuckers
Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns
Y'all can't fuck with Hov', what type of X y'all on?
I got great lawyers for cops so dress warm
Charges don't stick to dude he's teflon
I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred
I'm not guilty, now GIMME back my bread
Mr. District Attorney I'm not sure if they told you
I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to
plus - Hov' don't run, Hov' stand and fight
Hov's a soldier, Hov' been fightin all his life so
What could you do to me? It's not new to me
Sue me; fuck you - what's a couple dollars to me?
But you will respect me, simple as that
Or I got no problem goin back
I'm representin for the seat where Rosa Parks sat
Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The ruler's back
[Chorus]
(Best Rapper Alive) x4
[Jay-Z]
Uhh, uh-huh uhh uhh
I, am, BACK, niggaz - 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn the motherfuckin music up
[Jay-Z & Eminem] Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
[Eminem]"Give me the mic, show me where the fucking studio's at"
[Verse 2 - Eminem]
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex, a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass
[Chorus]
(Best Rapper Alive) x4

If I'm elected for ten terms
I'm renewing the staff after the inagural
And hiring all girls as interns
If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth
While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you
I'll take you straight to the pavement
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet
Like a razor that shaved it
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash
Runnin on stage in a g-string, wit a bee sting on my ass (look!)
It's probably all 'cause I ain't awkward at all
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall
And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawl
(hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll)
The bad and evil movement is comin
Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach
I write a rhyme a day
So it's no wonder how come your whole album
Is soundin like a bunch of shit that I would say
Whether it's one verse or one letter
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever
It's slim shady and tony touch, it's only us
The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit monie love
[Eminem Intro from "Cleanin out my closet"]
Where's my snares
i have no snares headphones in my ears
there ya go 
yo yo 
[CHORUS : Akon, Bone thugs]
I tried so hard can't seems gettin away from misery
man I tried so hard
always be victim of these streets
and ain't my fault cuz i
tryin to get away but trouble follows me
and still i try so hard
hopin one day come and rescue me but until then
i'be posted up right here
rain sleet hail snow
but until then
I'be posted up right here with my heat get dough
[2nd VERSE from "Love me" : EMINEM]
There's a certain mystique when I speak,
that you notice that's sorta unique,
cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep,
and I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat,
you can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
and go to sleep, I'm strapped,
just knowing any minute I could snap,
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped,
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically,
it ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry,
it ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
for you to play me, it's cockamanie,
you just ain't zaney enough to rock with Shady,
my noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clocks cuckoo,
I got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kit an' kaboodle,
I'm just brutal. It's no rumour, I'm numero uno, assume it,
there's no humour in it no more, you know
I'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag,
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
you better love me... bitch
[CHORUS : Akon, Bone thugs]
I tried so hard can't seems gettin away from misery
man I tried so hard
always be victim of these streets
and ain't my fault cuz i
tryin to get away but trouble follows me
and still i try so hard
hopin one day come and rescue me but until then
i'be posted up right here
rain sleet hail snow
but until then
I'be posted up right here with my heat get dough
[2nd VERSE from "Lose Yourself" : EMINEM]
The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner', but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da
[CHORUS : Akon, Bone thugs]
I tried so hard can't seems gettin away from misery
man I tried so hard
always be victim of these streets
and ain't my fault cuz i
tryin to get away but trouble follows me
and still i try so hard

[1st VERSE from "Like Toy Soldiers" : EMINEM]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Suge
And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause
[CHORUS : Akon, Bone thugs]
I tried so hard can't seems gettin away from misery
man I tried so hard
always be victim of these streets
and ain't my fault cuz i
tryin to get away but trouble follows me
and still i try so hard
hopin one day come and rescue me but until then
i'be posted up right here
rain sleet hail snow
but until then
I'be posted up right here with my heat get dough
Only reason I dissed you in the first place was because you denied seeing me
Now I'm pissed off
Sit back homie relax, in fact grab a six pack, kick back while I kick facts
Yeah Dre sick track, perfect way to get back
Wanna hear something wick wack?
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now
Oh gee, is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch shut the fuck up before I put all them phone calls out 
you made to my house when you was wild-n-out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out
You probably think cuz it's been so long if i had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixing our studio session down and sending it to mastering to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do
Mariah, it ever occur to you that I still have pictures?
However you prefer to do and that goes for Nick too faggot
You think I'm scared of you?
You gonna ruin my career you better get one
Like Ima sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt that made me put up with her psycho ass over 6 months and only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah, what you gonna say? I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly that you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base? What the fuck you tell Nick, pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humping. It's gotta count for something.
Listen, girly. Surely you don't want me to talk about how I nutted early cos I ejaculated prematurely and bust all over your belly, and you almost started hurling and said I was gross, go get a towel you're stomachs curling? 
Or maybe you do.
But if I'm embarrassing me, I'm embarrassing you and don't you dare say it isn't true.
As long as the songs' getting airplay I'm dissing you.
I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued.
I was gonna stop at 16 
That was 32 
This is 34 bars. We ain't even a third of the way through.
Damn, Slim. Mariah played you. Mariah who?
Oh did I say whore, Nick? I meant a liar too.
Like I've been goin off on you all this time for no reason.
Girl you out ya alcholic mind. Check ya wine cellar. Look at the amounts of all the wine.
Like I fuckin sit around and think about you all the time.
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme.
But fuck it now I'm bout to draw the line.
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb.
I can describe areas in your house you wouldn't find on an episode of Cribs
A blow below the ribs if I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs cos every time you do it's like an over load of fibs
I ain't saying this shit again, ho. You know what it is.
It's a warning shot before I blow up ya whole spot
Call my bluffin and I'll release every fucking thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryna stick two CD's in the same slot
(Slim Shady.... Slim Shady... I love you)
I love you too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo. Now what you say?
(It's nothing)
Ya so what I'll do
Is refresh your memory when you said I want you
Now should I keep going or should we call truce?
(You think you're cute, right? Hahaha)
You bet your sweet ass I do
(I'm Mary Poppins, B)
And I'm Superman, mmm
(Mary P. Slim Shady)
Comin' at you
So if you'll still be my (babygirl)
Then I'll still be your (Superhero, Oh my em.)
Yeah, I'm right here
(You like this)
Nope. Not anymore, Dear.
It cuts like a (knife) when I tell ya get a (life)
But I'm movin on with mine
Nick, is that your (wife)
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't (stick to the script) then Ima just keep goin
(I see Mary Ann. Mary Ann's saying cut the tape, cut the tape. Knife!)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
(Na na na nah na na nah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo, never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta till I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
Never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see, if it's true, if it's you
What you say In your raps, what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation
Any hesitation will get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, if you conceal it, reveal it
Bein' reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I love pissin' you off, hits me off, like my lawyers
When the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckas gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bring it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers, six-two, who needs bullets?
Soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out to the hot rocks parkin' lot
You'll all get shot, whether its your fault or not, 'cuz
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckas could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch
So ticky tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
Till the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that adverse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, I'm a
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
  (I'm a soldier)
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
  (I'm a soldier)
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
  (I'm a soldier)
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left

Eminem - Life
Life, by Marshall Mathers,
what is life?
life is like a big obstacle, in front of your optic wanna slow you down,
an every time you think you've gotten past it its gonna come back,
around and tackle you to the damn ground,
what are friends, friends are people that you think are friends,
but they really your enemies with secret identities,
and disguises to hide they' true colours, so just when you think you close enough to be brothers,
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin,
what is money, money is what makes a man act funny,
money is the root of all evil,
money'll make them same friends come back around,
swearin that they was always always down,
but it's life...im tired of life, im tired of backstabbin' ass snakes with friendly grins,
im tried of commitin so many sins,
tired of always givin in when this bottle of hennie wins,
tired of never havin' any ends
tired of havin' skinny friends so full on crack and many things,
im tired of this Dj, playin your shit when he spins,
im tired of not havin a deal, tired of havin to deal with this bullshit without grabbin the steel,
tired of drowin in my sorrow,
tired of havin to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo,
im tired of motherfuckers sprayin shit an dartin off,
im tired of jobs startin off at $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin off,
tired of being fired every time i fart and cough,
tired of havin to work as a gas station clerk for this jerk breatin down my neck, 
drivin me beserk,
im tired of using plastic silverwear 
tired of workin at buildin square,
tired of not being a millionare,
but if i had a million dollars i'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alchoholics,
if i had a magic wand, i'd make the world suck my d*ck without a condom on,
while im on  the jon,
if i had a millions bucks, it wouldn't be enough, cos i'd still be out robbin armoured trucks,
if i had one wish, i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss,
im tired of being white trash, broke an always poor,
tired of taken pop bottles back to the party store,
tired of not havin a phone, tired of not havin a home to have one in if i did have one on,
tired of not drivin a BM, tired of not workin at GM, tired of wantin to be him,
tired of not sleepin without atylanol PM,
tired of not performin in a packed collessium,
tired of not bein on tour,
tired of f*ckin the same blonde whore,
after work in the back of a contour,
im tired of fakin knots with a stack of ones, havin a lack of funds, an resort back to guns,
tired of bein stared at, tired of wearin the same damn nike air-hat,
tired of steppin in clubs wearin the same pair of luggs,
tired of people sayin they're tired of hearin me rappin bout drugs,
tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me sayin they wasn't feelin me or no-bodies as ill as me,
and I'm tired of radio stations tellin fibs tired of J.L.B. sayin we're hip hop lib's,
but if i had a million dollars i'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alchoholics,
if i had a magic wand, i'd make the world suck my d*ck without a condom on,
while im on  the john,
if i had a millions bucks, it wouldn't be enough, cos i'd still be out robbin armoured trucks,
if i had one wish, i would ask for one big enough ass for the whole world to kiss,
you know what i'm sayin? im tired of all of this bullshit,
tellin me to be positive, how am i supposed to be positive when i don't see shit positive,
you know what i'm sayin?
i rapp about shit around me, shit i see,
you know what i'm sayin?
and right now i'm tired of everything,
tired of all this, player hating that's going on in my own city,
you can't get away or play, 
you know what i'm sayin',
but hey, it's cool though,
you know what i'm sayin'?
i'm just fed up, thats my world
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?
Hi kids, do you like violence?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails
Through each one of my eyelids?
(Uh, huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
(Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
(Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
(Umm)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead"
Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted
Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard
I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut
(Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
(Oww)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians
In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
(Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Aah)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away
(Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
(Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
(Hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
(C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me, mom?
(Wah)
You ain't got no tits
(Wah)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
(Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Mmhh
You high baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Ha ha ha, talk to me
You want me to tell you somethin'?
Uh huh
I know what you wanna hear
'Cuz I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a mo'fuckin slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe
'Cuz I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
You'll never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass

They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl
First thing you said
I'm not phazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me
Ooh yeah girl run that game
Hailie Jade I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
'Rot in pieces' aww that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good lordy-wody
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooo girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass

Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman
Superman
Once again it's the sinister cynical minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain
Just finished huffin the paint
And muffled the fumes like it
was nothin because it ain't
Anything in his his way
His enemies he just slays
His venom he sprays
Reaches like beams of energy rays
Menecing stance
He glares making the hairs all on the back of your neck stand
Like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep he's a tarantula
Gargantuan yeah Angela
So I command you to start dancin
Part Manson part Hannibal
Part mechanical shark throwin
Animal parts at Scarlett Johannson
Enter my gas chamber
Ya gangster? my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck
He's set to strangle your ass hater
Your facin a task greater
He's chasin your ass
He's got his face in a mask
And blood stains on his glass table
I'm checking the exposure
of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing
Next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dosing off
Overdosing
Windows opening shutting
Doors opening closing
I think there's a ghost
Too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only supposed to swallow half
I took the whole thing
I'm not joking
I think I just snorted my nosering
I need a drink I'm standing over the sink hosing
Myself self loathing cause I'm on the brink closely
I don't wanna think
These'll make everything rosy
Beverly sings Scream while I'm severing Three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm Jodeling Rosyyyyyy won't you come out to play
No sense wasting time
Cutting and pasting headlines of the papers
Making shrines of my crimes and capers
My world's a whirlwind
I murdered my girlfriend
Go to Europe and put neruphins in my syrup
And stir them
You've never heard him, like this
So don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon coke lyrics
And lyrics worsen
The kind of person
To get paid in Kurichs to curse and
Eighty spirits of ladies get Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of the events that he emerged
To go to the world and got rid of all the children
Load them into the building
And kill'm and bury them in the mud
And mildew and he will do what he feels
And still can spit drawin the gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton and silk, Motrin and Tylenol three pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin
Nothin but crumpled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildred
He's amped with it he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he
Emcees will get fricasseed on the grill, then
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh, no
I won't back down, oh, no
Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe De Villes
Brain dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth and nails
Try to fight it, try to deny it
Stupid you will feel, what I do, I do at will
Shooting from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death bed
Screaming F that yeah super Ill
Baby, what the deal, we can chill
Split half a pill and a happy meal, fuck a stank slut
I cut my toes off and step on the receipt before I foot the bill
Listen garden tool don't me introduce you to my power tool
You know the fucking drill
How you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?
Summers eve Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal, baby, crank the shit
'Cause it's your God damn jam
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shawty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said
Settle ya fuckin ass down I'm ready for combat, man
Get it calm Batman?
Nah, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like mum's cat scans
Cause they fucking dope bananas, honey I applaud that ass
Swear to God man these moms can't dance, ma show 'em how it's done
Spazz like a goddamn Tas, yeah
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh, no
I won't back down, oh, no
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinsons
Make like Michael J Fox in the jaws playin' with a etch a sketch
Betcha that you'll never guess who's knocking at your door
People hit the floors
Yeah, tonight ladies, you gon get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with
Chris's paws like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue muthfucker
You ain't gotta lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their draws
Think you spit the raw, I'm an uncut slab of beef
Laying on your kitchen floor
Other words I'm off the meat rack, bring the beat back
Bring me two extension chords
I'mma measure my dick, shit, I need 6 inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch
Need I remind you that I don't need the fucking swine flu
To be a sick pig, you're addicted I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here
Need a fix up I'm the big shot, get it dicks nuts
Your just small boats little pricks
Girl you think that other pricks hot
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
'Fore I sit back and let 'em get hot
Better call the cops on 'em quick fast
Shady's right back on your bitch ass
White trash with half a six pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitched attached to the back
(Dispatch)
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh, no
I won't back down, oh, no
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping
Does a bird chirp?
Does Lil Wayne slurps syrup 'til he burps and smokes purp?
Does a word search gets circles wrapped around it like
You do when I come through, I'd like you to remind yourself
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
Or your the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Psych I'm spiking you like a football
Been this way since I've stood a foot tall
Your'e a good catch with a shitty spouse
Pretty mouth and a good jaw
Gimme good brain
Watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain
Bitch, you listening tryna' turn me down
Slut I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shits playin'
I'ma shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder there's lightening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate ocassions?
And you can bet your stanking ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road took the pyschopath
Poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
So hit the dance floor, cutie
While I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty shawty I'm the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me Doodi
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh, no
I won't back down, oh, no
I told ya'll mothafuckas I was comin' back
(Oh shit)
What now nigga, what now?
(What are you doin'?)
What?
Proof, the projects, nigga
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
Security's gone I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my muthafuckin' gun
(Nigga, what about your wife?)
Nigga fuck my wife, I'm tryin' ta run and save my muthafuckin' life
Oh shit, the shooter's comin'
Bitches hollerin', niggas runnin', people shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin' ta make it to the St. Andrew's door
That's the sound of the glock
Even DJ House fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex
(Kuniva you awright)
These niggas is trippin'
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'
This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But it's real and it's on and cats is gettin' killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she's yellin'
(Don't leave me)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38, I hope it's not too late
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
(I been tryna call you all day, mothafucka, where you at?)
I'm on seven mile, what the fuck was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat nigga and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?)
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
(Shit, that's the clique we beefin' wit)
Man and I was on my way there
Believe me I'm leavin' a caucus today
I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum-wad from out the parkin' lot
Gets in an argument over a parkin' spot
Decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
Into St. Andrew's hall, now the strays flyin' all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face, another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar havin' a mazel tov
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von, he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
No, I guess not, what the fuck, oh my God it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
Goddamn, there just went another damn bullet, I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Follow Bizarre's path ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
It's Friday night came to this bitch, right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cuz I'm poppin' niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that the schmuck that
Shot out the back of his truck is up in this mothafucka
So one shot for the money, two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender
(There's plenty of shots to go)
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
Aww look at daddy's baby girl, that's daddy baby
Little sleepy head, yesterday I changed your diaper

You and your husband have a fight one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced

And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
Oh my God

Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, mother*** say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace, smack the *** in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh you got me mistaken honey

The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, 'The Vapors'
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so

Make up to break up n***** need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then *** your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
She don't remember ***, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the ***
Suckin' on the ***, had the hooker beggin' for the ***
And your moms ain't ugly love, my *** got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown

Then I *** in her E Y E

Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis after she sucked the ***
I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to *** him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin' in a room, *** him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is *** feelin' it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a ***
Stab ya till you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen

Human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism

And I never eat you unless the ***, meat looks fresh

Whose arm is this?
I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
Who refused to ret roll my servitude scripts in the derby sets 
(sorry)(correction: who refused to renew my seventh prescription of Darvisetts)
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
That never leaves his house, cos he thinks his car's possessed.
I hate my life
That's why I degrade my wife
Grab the paper plate to make a sandwich in the state of night
(correction: grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich, and just ate the knife)
My mother screaming "Please hear me, that it straight to Christ!"
(correction:my mother's screaming :"Please heal him take him straight to Christ)
Meets are in the streets and slap me just to break the ice (What up my man?)
(correction: meet u in ht estreet an slap you just to break the ice: what up ? 
im eminem_)
Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice 
pistol whip u and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbing my head to some bullshit you were spitting
I was probably just trying to shake the lice (UUURRRGGGHHH)
Bums falling out of my head
(correction: bums falling outta my head)
I'm wishing I was dead
While I'm falling out of my bed
Pissing violet red.
And my raps are returning
I feel the sensation of burning.
The purple use of the germ with the painful release of my yermin (correction: 
painful release of my urine)
I'm screaming in my saddle "PLEASE QUIT FOLLOWING ME!!!!!"
(correction: i;m screaming at my shadow: "please quit following me!")
These pills keeps screaming, "Please quit swallowing meeee!"
The devil keeps screaming, "Please keep telling on me!"
(correction: the devil keeps whispering:"please get down on one knee")
I took the drugs before the cops or they found them on me
(correction: i took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me)
(Prolonged moaning scream)

(scratch) Wat...(scratch) Watch this! (scratch) Watch this!!!!!!!!!!
Psst..
Hey, Listen
I love my job
It makes me feel like... superman
Can you fly?
I can
Wanna see?
[Chorus]
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me... entertain you
[Verse 1]
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with congress HAS
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope there's a spark
But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because
[Chorus x1]
[Verse 2]
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious
It might be confusing
Trying to seperate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it?
I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde
'cause' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin' constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone re-building
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy ?
Probably millions
But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then...
[Chorus X1]
[Verse 3]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see thats why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimmick ever move you make
"Slim you're great"
But wait, can't you see im only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'cause man, I see it, feel it, live it
But its inhumane for me to see you be influenced
And pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that i've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And its such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust
[Chorus X1]
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people and 5 I hit
Ah shit I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped the foster kids
These 'shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed I meant coke dumb ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb and is dashing town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out, come on
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von you see me stepping on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid 'cuz the X is gone
Ya I took them all dog with some Parmesans
And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb
Young, dumb and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass, it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on
So stop acting stupid, you so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit
Yeah I think I did too much
This substance equals cups
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills, that's ill, mescaline
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
Dirty dozen, 80 of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
[Incomprehensible]
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snorted two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was incredible I killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away like a Rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray look for coke to smoke
I overdose when I pack up my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby born by whore lady
Now I'm gonna strangle a, you're crazy!
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
You got any shroom? Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get job because our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack then I might too, Swift, chill
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue
Speed, shrooms, down the Valiums
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and I'm going back soon
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I'm at rave looking like a slave, high off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smelt like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid-dropping, dope heavy guy
Heroine, mescaline, pencil neck, wanna try
Blue pills, golden seals got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill, yeah, right, bitch I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt, let Bizarre nut
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
Dirty dozen 80 of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
[Incomprehensible]
Still on?
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check
Alright, let's do it
Let's go, come on
Eminem
Eminem
Eminem
...
Detroit, Motown
Hey guess what, they gave us two bonuses this year
And you know what happened?
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Hennied up, ginnied up, ski mask, black truck
Dickey outfit, passenger side, pistol grip pump
Fuck it I just did two lines
A chrome tech nine, it'll tear out niggaz spines
It's a party, go on in and have fun
'Cause after it's over all you gon' hear is
Shootin', blastin', hittin' the floor
Ten-thousand in the safe, shit I'm 'bout to score
'Cause I'm dangerous, off Angeldust
Shit I'll bust even the nigga that came with us
And this is for my nigga's that be robbin' and stealin'
Carjackin', murder one's, and fuckin' drug dealin'
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
I stumble in the club blowed up, nine millimeter cocked
Something's telling me to stop, fuck it I don't see the cops
Nigga's don't believe until they see it's out
Stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
Beggin' me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that naked
Come out of them diamonds and you come out of that velor
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back up shit I can use it
I need the noise in case I have to let a couple off
Saw another icey chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that butter soft, and since you buyin' out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow
I'm out for the paper, my homie better hide the jewels
I'm in the game starvin', and I ain't playin' buy the rules nigga
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder
(Murder, murder)
Sh-sh-Shady
Yeah, oh, get up, I said get up, let's go
Better watch out, now, here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the mornin' sun
So give us room to do our thing
'Cuz we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone
Now first of all I'm the boss, I just wanna get that across
Man even my Dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche
Garbage bag on one of the windows
Spray  painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here come on get him, if you dames want 'em
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him?
'Cuz you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now could I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right up off her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Now, get up, dance
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cuz we're havin' a White Trash Party
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from 'Night of the Livin' Dead'
And tomorrow I'll prolly still be too high to get outta bed
'Til I feel like I been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot to kill like I'm hollerin' "Die Santa"
Miss the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you pawlin'
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cuz as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for them ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, cuz homie that hood's tighter then Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy, c'mon
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cuz we're havin' a White Trash Party
Now whether you're black, white or purple if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good, get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood
Now honey, don't let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
'Cuz girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift and
Make a five seater, I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece 'a dry pita
I'll be the S, L to the I, M to the S, H, A, D, Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown, I'll tell ya now
I'm so raw I still need to unthaw, you feel me, yall?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up
Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
'Cuz we're havin' a White Trash Party

and if it's not a rapper that i'll make it as
I'ma be a fucking rapist in a jason mask
[Chorus x4]
Ladies and gentlemen
You are now about to witness the strength, Aftermath
Straight out the motherfuckin' streets of Compton
Put yo' hands together, The Game, bitch
Yeah, yeah motherfuckers
Compton's back on the motherfuckin' map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game, let's go
Me and Marshall ain't start shit, they listen to our shit
And talk shit about us, but that shit is foul
When I'm tryin' to feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist
They say shit, but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest
Like Biggie and 'Pac was, we saw the throne was empty
And decided to chase it, me him and 50 racin'
This rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit
Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth, and one take it
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hit
Then spit that classical L.A. N.W.A. shit
The media is bullshit, now we can't even say bitch
They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this, swear to God I erase 'em
Put the clip in and waste 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired of this black shit, this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this, so they callin' us
(We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you)
(We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you)
This day, the game, will never be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangsters
The game just isn't the same, it's changin'
It's a new game, you're now about to witness the power
Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm makin'
If I'm fakin', I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you tame bitch
Your mind's lost, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangsters in your face
Which way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement?
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits wavin'
In my face lookin' for answers, rap sensation
Eminem battles to ward off, accusations
That he had somebody blasted, the mask of Jason
Was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wastin'
Too much time, me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't goin'
(We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you)
(We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you)
This day, the game, will never be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangsters
The game just isn't the same, it's changin'
It's a new game, you're now about to witness the power
The Game
Lo, get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em just killed me on my own shit
I'm walkin' through 8 Mile, startin' to get homesick
I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the windows tinted
If Eminem is in it, body armor under the panel
Ten these niggaz is killin' it, take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I throw your demo out the window
For tellin' me, it's hot when it's not and you got
What you got from them rocks on the block you can stop
Tellin' Dre, you got shot with a glock that don't fade me
I'm crazy, why the fuck you think I'm rhymin' with Shady?
I don't care if the radio don't play me; I say
What I say when I feel like I'm Phil-in-the-Day
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks, so I'm gone bitch
(We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you)
(We ain't, goin', nowhere, so fuck you)
This day, the game, will never be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangsters
The game just isn't the same, it's changin'
It's a new game, you're now about to witness the power
The Game
Yeah, oh
Shut yo' ass up, Aftermath motherfucker
Game, things changin', Dr. Dre, G-Unit
G-G-G-Unit
Good evening, 
This is your fucking captain speaking. 
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet 
That's eight million miles in the sky. 
Please, undo your seatbelt for takeoff. 
(pshh) You are now free to smoke about the cabin 
I'm Dre from back in the day from, 
NWA from black and the gray from, 
Choking a bitch to smacking her face from, 
Stacking up bodies to, Racking their kegs up. 
From racking a bitch to, 
Stacking them crates up, 
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm. 
And we're what's happening in rap entertainment, Me and Shady. 
Far as competition, faggot there ain't none 
Speak of the devil, It's attack of the Rainman 
Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron 
Soon as the blade spun (vrun) they run away from 
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from. 
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one. 
Wait, it ain't funny man it's urgent, I need one. 
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun, and an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1. 
(Chorus)
So one more time for old time's sake 
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break 
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way 
And let's go 
We're now smoking with the best (the best) 
I said one more time for old time's sake 
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break 
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way 
And let's go 
We're now smoking with the best (the best) 
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless 
A nice environment 
Surprise, entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants 
taking lives of firemen, say goodbye. 
Here I am again, naked wives and Vicodin. 
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin 
(Vin, vin!)
Fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge 
Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him 
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again 
Baby, make us some French toast and show off some skin. 
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin. 
Show me nipple I pinch, blow up, then throw up a ten. 
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again, 
The sorcerer of intercourse - if it's forced, it's him. 
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within, 
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain 
(Chorus) 
So one more time for old time's sake 
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break 
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way 
And let's go 
We're now smoking with the best (the best) 
I said one more time for old time's sake 
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break 
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way 
And let's go 
We're now smoking with the best (the best) 
Now where there's smoke, there's fire 
Where there's fire, there's flames 
Where there's flames, there's chronic 
Either you high or you ain't 
I got no time for no games 
Nah, uh he ain't playing 
He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your bra-ain 
I'm slightly insa-ane; Vodka and Creatine 
Hpnotiq and Red Bull, It's an incredible energy drink
And it's givin' me wings, I believe I can fly 
While I pee on a girl; You won't catch me CSI! 
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake 
Dre, get on the mic and make them tremble and shake 
Now put your smoke up in the air 
Raise your Henny and Coke 
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know 
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it 
Let's get into it, you're smoking with the triedest and truest 
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up, 
You motherfuckers ain't smoking, you just holding shit up 
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt. 
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one. 
Cuz if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed. 
Now them words are just a little more personal for me. 
Seeing as how I blew up off of puffing them trees 
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up Cheech! 
Come on, smoke me out, cuz, give me contact buzz 
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff. 
But this is earth calling Shady, man come on back (what?) 
Man we're losing him; he won't even respond back, fuck!
Now look at all the pretty women in here 
(Damn bitches) 
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures 
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages 
Now baby just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit just... 
(Chorus)
And give more time for old time's sake 
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break. 
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way 
And let's go 
We're now smoking with the best (the best) 
I said one more time for old time's sake 
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that break. 
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way 
And let's go 
We're now smoking with the best (the best)
{Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
He decides to rob a liquor store
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play}
Alright, stop!
(Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence
(But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in and gaffe the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that! Do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
(You're right)
Not over this shit
(Stop!)
Drop the biscuit
(I will)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
You know what Dre I don't like your attitude
{Meet Stan, twenty-one years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play}
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitches earlobe
Yo this girls only 15 years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
(Ah huh)
Fuck this bitch right on that spot there
Till she passes out she forgot how she got their
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie kids?
No, but I seen the porno that's on nubiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail
{Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man}
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit! You just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off
Wait! what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What'chu say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill ya motherfucker
Ah ha, temper, temper
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. A.K. comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aww fuck it what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?
Chorus: Now I don't really care what you call me You can even call me cold These bitches know as soon as they saw me Its never me to get the privilege to know 'em I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go Still I ball like there's no tomorrow good nights its over and thats all she wrote
1st Verse: Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate, Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape Cupid shot his arrow and missed Wait Sarah you're late, your train left. Mascara and eggs smeared on your face Nights over goodbye, hoe I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut aint nothing to cry over Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up, Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her, She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up. She must've took me for some high roller. But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' roll cola. Buy u a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder. If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars You get your eyes swole up i'm on my straight grizzly So why would i buy you a gayass teddy bear,bitch you're already bi-polar 
(Chorus)
2nd Verse: Man TIP told me on this hoe tip, best tip I could give you to hip you Never let these traits trick you Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit Dig you a hole, take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch Shit you talk about some adivce that sticks with you If i should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns Like double stick, its you but fuck 'em TIP, its cold Its chilling like and feeling like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you Before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch You think this is some Nintendo game how f-cking dumb is you I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump somes with you So here's a penny for your thoughts But it won't buy you a chesseburger, although a nickle might just get you one pickle Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue Thats a bombshell, scud missle!

(Chorus 
3rd Verse: I guess life is a bitch aint it tip And each one thinks they the shit Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my hankercheif I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine Let em get a good taste of it I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now, But in case you didnt Imma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it So I pace this shit a little bit quicker That clock I'm racing and double timing it But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time It may take you pricks to catch on While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong Man I still say K-mart like theres an apostrophe "S" on it dog And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong But if you gon tell me that the A&W aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg
(Chorus)
I told ya'll mothafuckas I was comin' back
(Oh shit)
What now nigga, what now?
(What are you doin'?)
What?
Proof, the projects, nigga
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
Security's gone I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my muthafuckin' gun
(Nigga, what about your wife?)
Nigga fuck my wife, I'm tryin' ta run and save my muthafuckin' life
Oh shit, the shooter's comin'
Bitches hollerin', niggas runnin', people shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin' ta make it to the St. Andrew's door
That's the sound of the glock
Even DJ House fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex
(Kuniva you awright)
These niggas is trippin'
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin'
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin'
This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin'
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin'
But it's real and it's on and cats is gettin' killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she's yellin'
(Don't leave me)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38, I hope it's not too late
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
(I been tryna call you all day, mothafucka, where you at?)
I'm on seven mile, what the fuck was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat nigga and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?)
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
(Shit, that's the clique we beefin' wit)
Man and I was on my way there
Believe me I'm leavin' a caucus today
I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum-wad from out the parkin' lot
Gets in an argument over a parkin' spot
Decides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door
Into St. Andrew's hall, now the strays flyin' all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face, another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar havin' a mazel tov
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von, he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
No, I guess not, what the fuck, oh my God it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin' ass, I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein' trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
Goddamn, there just went another damn bullet, I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Follow Bizarre's path ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
It's Friday night came to this bitch, right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cuz I'm poppin' niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that the schmuck that
Shot out the back of his truck is up in this mothafucka
So one shot for the money, two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender
(There's plenty of shots to go)
(I just wanna know who's drivin' a black Mitsubishi)
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots, all I hear is gunshots
This is where the fun stops, bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off
Party stops, everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin' shots off
Shady, that's me
High & Mighty Trilogy back with the fliest material
Shady, Shady, that's me
High and Mighty Trilogy back with the funky beats
Packin' this third eye, pursue a Cyclops
They trade in they high tops for nice sized white rocks
Words in my right, that pass my left ear
Your style is ass-out like the Bulls are next year
Fear this veneer, you get stung like virgins
Who that cat splurgin' instead of rehearsing'?
Tough guys, degentrify your high rise
Lookin' more like Ronald than them fuckin' Fry Guys
Go on uptown fuckin' senoritas
In Taco Bell screamin', "Viva gorditas"
Bring all your dogs, I give em rabies
They never had a chance like my two aborted babies
Got Pope John Paul the second, prayin' to Satan
Have your vegan girlfriend cookin' up bacon
On barbiturates with that shit that you hit
Smoke my spliffs withcha, 'cause spinal bifida
My nine is liftin' ya, six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with twelve shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher, don't get carried away now
No pun intended, just hop out of your whip
And leave it un-attended before I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
'Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cave women, while I'm gravediggin' with Marilyn Manson
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit
And if you spittin' wack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'ma detach it
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it
Yo yo, Eon's wack now, how you think that?
Couldn't get on my record if you were shrink rap
Desecrate a crate with these rhymes I be totin'
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
To the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat
Let's go back in time and steal my whole steez
The Quickening, did a bris at the christenin'
I'm exercisin', doin' liftings and twistings
Instinct's the nicest, I keep tellin' you
What the fuck this guy on the corner been sellin' you?
Here, buy this
I'm e-mailin' you at the wrong website
And mispellin' you, prank you and put the fear of hell in you
Escaped Bellevue, stuffed the nurse in a purse
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse
Slim Shady, a perverted version of birth
Drivin' off, leavin' a murdered virgin at church
The first person who searchin' the earth for the motherfucker
That pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first
Get thrown curves and hit with your own words
Leave me alone, bitch, I get on my own nerves
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
I'm takin' off both shoes and stickin' each middle toe up
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit
And if you spittin' wack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'ma detach it
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it
Any disease out there, I'm willin' to catch it
Slim Shady, all praises to the High & Mighty
Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon, illest rhyme dropper
Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon, illest rhyme dropper
Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon, illest rhyme dropper
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe 'em somethin'
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here
You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run their mouth and try to take shots at me
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
With it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge, thinkin' of Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wrist watches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
Startin' shit like some 26 year old skinny Cartman
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good ol' fashioned
Passionate ass-whoopin' and gettin' your shoes coat
And your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it
Vanilla Ice don't like me
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin, "I don't care, just bite me"
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4 year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves, clowns, 'cause they look queer
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help from D-12 to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
"Slim Anus," you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm not a wrestler guy, I'll knock you out if you talk about me
Come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes doubt me
And if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot at me
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
And this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter you faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90-some cousins
(Hey, it's me)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey, hey and then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uhh, here double XL, double XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself
'Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and take shots at me
'Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and take shots at me
The World Ain'T Ready For Me Yet (Prod. by Mart85)
Eminem
[Verse 1]
Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place
I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides'
And spray-paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
And chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
I'm from the city where the weather's always real cold
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed
We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa 
[Hook:]
It's like this and like that and like this (huh-huh)
My name is Marshall Mathers (I think that's my name)
Cause this is how I am in real life 
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa 
It's like this and like that and like this (ya hear me?)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa 
[Verse 2]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer 
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And aint shit changed
But kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not?  Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now
[Hook: Rihanna]

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy



[Verse 1: Eminem]

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek

Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey

Wanted to receive attention for my music

Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me

For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways

Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated

When I blew; see, but it was confusing

Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam

(Ooh!) Hit the lottery, oh wee

But with what I gave up to get was bittersweet

It was like winning a used mink

Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink

I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep

Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith

But I'm actually weirder than you think cause I'm...



[Hook: Rihanna]

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy



[Bridge: Rihanna]

Well, that's nothing



[Verse 2: Eminem]

No, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody

Once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it

Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow

So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder

Where these thoughts spawn from

(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this?

No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders)

Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo

I think you've been wandering off down yonder

And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster

And save me from myself and all this conflict

Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it

My OCD is conking me in the head

Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking

I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying

Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...



[Hook: Rihanna]

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy



[Bridge: Rihanna]

Well, that's nothing



[Verse 3: Eminem]

Call me crazy, but I have this vision

One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian

But until then drums get killed

And I'm coming straight at MCs, blood get spilled

And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track

Give every kid who got played at, pumped up feeling

And shit to say back to the kids who play 'em

I ain't here to save the fucking children

But if one kid out of a hundred million

Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates, that's great

It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft

Turn nothing into something, still can make that, straw into gold chump

I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack

Maybe I need a straight jacket face facts, I am nuts for real

But I'm okay with that, it's nothing, I'm still friends with the...



[Hook: Rihanna]

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head

You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy



[Bridge: Rihanna]

Well, that's nothing

Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
I get lifted and spin till I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin till my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash whiskey and ash till I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me you'll get in imagine this
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope?
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
"You fuckin' homo", that's what I said at my dad's funeral
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
That's why the city is filled
With a bunch of fuckin' idiots still
That's why the first motherfucker poppin'
Some shit he gets killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit
We call it Amityville
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill!
We don't do drivebys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with them too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here?
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibres here?
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year?
'Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen
When a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you
And they found you and your family in it
God damnit he meant it when he tells you
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
Mentally ill from Amityville
Mentally ill from Amityville
Accidentally kill your family still

Verse 1
I'm like this rufted nigga, you made me crazy,
You should have slaved me as a baby,
Behavin shadier the wes craven,
And you ain't even gotta pay me,
I take pleasure of layin a nigga down daily,
You face me, fuck it's over, you think fast,
I'm never fucked up to where I cant whip your ass,
Your neck will get snaped with bare hands,
Fuck you, they say rappin is cool,
But fool just don't confuse it,
What happens is you's get rude and then I loose it,
I'm scatless (? ? ), I blow your two ears off the atless,
With a gat thats bigger then godzilla back nigga,
You are not will'in, in fact, your through to ya factered (? ? ),
A crack dealer, your president sends me smack
And got a mac 10 with it so I ain't gotta rap,
I'm thankfull for that, don't mistaken me black,
Or you'll be stinkin in the back of a fuckin cadalak...
(eminem)
I'm a get snuffed cause I ain't said enough to pipe down,
I pipe down when the fuckin (blanked) whipped out,
When I see that little (blanked) dyke get sniped out,
Lights out bitch, odioss, goodnight (blowe)
Now put that in your little pipe and whipe down,
Think for a minute cause the hype had died down,
That I wont go up in the oval office right now,
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down,
I'm all for america, fuck the government,
Tell that seat of laws, tell that slut ta suck a dick,
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck, son of a bitch,
Take away my gun, I'm gonna talk some other shit,
Cant tell me shit about the tricks of this trade,
Switch blade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a 6 to a 16 inch blade,
The shits like a samari sword, a censay,
Shit just don't change ta this day,
I'm this way still tell that ut-slay its-bay,
I'm a say my ick-day, choose my ick-pay,
Addenlay, but uck-fay, ick-kay...
Chorus 1
(eminem)
This rap game, this rap game,
I ain't sell'in my soul for this rap game,
Now I ain't digg'in no hole for this rap game,
But I'm tellin ya no it ain't happenin..
This rap game, this rap game,
I ain't sell'in my soul for this rap game,
I ain't digg'in no hole for this rap game,
This rap game, this rap game...
Verse 2
I bet ya lovin me (? ? ), drink and drown in my own iniquity,
But fuck that, I'm gonna rap till y'all get sick of me,
And clutch my last sack, it's been all who big on me,
I'm pickin a rot mix, fuck the dog who single me,
I'm saying you motherfuckers, don't know'ith, who playin,
If I'm broke, then I'm brakin open the place where you layin,
You know, same she every nigga done in his life,
I livin this why (? ? ), speak long (? ? ), what I blow when I write,
So why, should i, ever fear another man, if he bleed like I bleed,
Take a piss when he stand, ok you win, you can say we cant rap
But no shots (? ? ), never me (? ? ), you never (? ? ), and I don't wanna (? ? ),
When they say it was wack...
I walk in the party and just start bustin,
Right after I hear the last verse of self destruction,
This liquer makes me wanna blast the chrome,
To let you know that time without morse dangerom (? ? ), (nigga)
I low down and shifty, quickly call swifty,
To do a drive-by on the ten speed with fifty,
You feelin lucky squeeze, I catch you outside of chucky cheese,
With you see (? ? ) who be unlucky g, my lifestyle is unstable,
A partyin addict, they said no fightin in the club
So I brought me a matic, coughin the static,
I jump nigga's call me a rabbit,
Pop in the tavern and guns are so just irratic...
Chorus 2
Believe me, we run this rap shit forchezy,
Make makin millions look easy,
Everywhere you turn you see me,
You hear me..
Believe me, you see my pistol and three dead,
No time to call the peace treaty,
Dial 911 cause you need the...,
Police to help you, believe me,
Verse 3
I haft to tunnel from the side walk and piss on the curve,
This is obserde, these street nigga's twistin my words,
We finally could say goodbye to hollywood,
Cause boots and shine pants, is nothin in commin,
The nasty been with gasoline cans (? ? ),
We never bow down to be a flashin a pig (? ? ),
No one must, fuck this statue dawg,
Nothin to do with hands when I clap with yall,
Put your job on the ground (? ? ), then the dog in the pound (? ? ),
Then I'm goin out of town, for the law come around,
So we can battle with raps, we can battle gats,
Matter a fact we can battle with placks,
(eminem)
This rap game
(bizarre)
I'm too fuckin retarted, I don't give a fuck about my dick,
Thats why I'm date'in raymond bobbet,
My crew had a arguement who was the largest,
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist,
Plus I made the beat to all the raps,
Well I really didnt but I did according to this contract,
I was thrown in the snow with no where to go,
Freezin 20 below forced to join, bail shit, then blow (? ? ),
My little girl, she should'nt listen to these lyrics,
Thats why I glued here headphones to her ears,
To make sure she hear it,
If rap don't work I'm startin a group with garth brooks,
Ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha
This ain't the hook... (? ? )
Chorus 1
Scalpel
Here
Sponge
Here
Wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my, oh my God
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts, "Nurse we're losin' him, check the pulse"
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high, this kid said
"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp' this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
"I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?"
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty and I started to shake at first
Something told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache it works"
I screamed, "My appendix feels like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse"
"What's the matter?"
"I don't know, my leg, it hurts"
"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy?"
"Oh, I mean it is but I also got a bum knee"
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
"But don't you wanna give me after school detention?"
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him"
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage
Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious 'cause his father boxes
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beat"
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honkey"
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
"This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back bully, now once and for good"
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', "What are you on, drugs?
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done?"
"Oh my God, I'm sorry son", "Shut up you cunt", I said, "Fuck it"
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage
It's brain damage
I got brain damage
It's brain damage
It's probably brain damage
It's brain damage
Brain damage
I got brain damage

[Eminem] 
Here we go again 
[50 Cent] 
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow? 
You can't understand how I get my dough 
50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so 
I'm on fire 
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne 
I just get on the track and try to set the tone 
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone 
But don't compare me 
I'm better off jus' left alone 
And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales 
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself 
Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12 
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail 
And livin wreckless 
But if you go check my belt 
You may see something else I used to protect myself 
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells 
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel 
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to 
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you 
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line 
But this motherfucker Ja musta lost his mind 
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX 
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next 
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael 
Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled 
We'd all much rather get along and fight you 
Me and Hailie danced to your songs we liked you 
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth 
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you 
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to 
But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you 
Killin' you fasta than you poppin' pill afta little pill of them tabs of that shit you on 
But if you want it you got it you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it 
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta 
We bump heads wit any motherfucker that wants to 
So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk? 
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg? 
How come you didn't say you had a problem then? 
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then 
I'ma grown man dawg come holla 
All you did was slapdance, smile and swallow, 
another one of them little X pills in front of me 
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be come on 
[50 Cent] 
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon will see 
You don't wanna bump heads with me 
I know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon you will see 
You know you don't want it with me 
[Tony Yayo] 
You couldn't son me if my father helped you 
My punchlines is hot, my bars'll melt you 
Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you 
Every other week I'm buyin a new pistol 
I clap at your ass with this chrome 38 
And put six thru your hats of seven 3/8 
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night 
I put my knife in ya wind pipe and freeze ya on the turnpike 
You know and I know who took ya chain 
You got robbed two times so ya ass is laid 
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail 
You betta stick to tha movies with Steven Seigel, bitch 
[50 Cent] 
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon will see 
You don't wanna bump heads with me 
I know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon you will see 
You know you don't want it with me
[Lloyd Banks] 
Fuck that I'm miles away 
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand 
I'ma find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man 
Tellin' New York, even in Compton they understand 
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate out tha game an'... 
They see me more pop a boy for icey 'cause I could 
Shootin' guns for money you probably forgot your way around the hood 
Bitch when you paranoid it's hard to make a song 
Now you want it wit' us, half your artists got to make a point 
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer picture 
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches 
You don't know nuttin' about what pain is sucka 
I'll put your ass to the ground like a train conductor, muh'fucker 
[50 Cent] 
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon will see 
You don't wanna bump heads with me 
I know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon you will see 
You know you don't want it with me

Yeah nigga yeah 
Shady Aftermath G-Unit

Artist: da ruckus f/ eminemreal *echoes*
Chorus: samples 4x
"bust it rugged, shine like a gold nugget" (what they know about this? )
"when I bust on the mic, I bust a real hard rhyme" ---> keith murray
"every time I pick up the microphone I drug it (what they know about
This? )
"when I bust on the mic, I bust a real hard rhyme" ---> keith murray
[verse one]
I'm rockin shit, packin shit, while stackin shit
If anyone steps up askin shit, I'm blastin shit
You gone phase me, but swingin like peter parker
Motherfuck the shop, I'll wreck the goddamn barber
Forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up
You couldn't be a dope mc if you said his rhymes drugged up
I told you once, but you forget so here's a flashback
"you couldn't be shit, if you came out my asscrack"
Stop frontin kid, you know you ain't paid
And the only mic/mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade
Ain't nothin lyrical about you but your lies
So cut the shit, cause it's startin to draw flies
You're played like my five-year old's newborn toys
Don't know shit about chicago, but I could still make illa noyz
Like robin leech I display stylish ways
Thats rough like my face when I haven't shaved in days
Listen up, all these words take heed
When I cock and squeeze, no more mc's breathe (none)
I'm sick of this, here's my final dis
Fuck you dumb niggaz you ain't shit like this
Chorus: 2x
[eminem]
My smith and wessy got you layin in some alley messy
Got your family lookin for your ass on sally jesse
We squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin no more
Leavin your skull split like steven seagal
Let the cat out, flat out, detroit's a mad house
So I don't get offended when I hear my city badmouthed
We quick to pull the gat out and set it
And leave you with more shit missin than a lil' kim radio edit
Stick up kids be tryin to live paid
You get your grill sprayed with twenty-seven bullets in your ribcage
Get the guage, cock it back, empty your pockets, jack
Or i'ma send you flyin like a rocketpack
Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack
Break into your crib still your shit and lock it back
Ten-year old kids be standin on the block with gats
Just for livin nowadays'll get you flocked with bats
Where I'm from...yaknow what'm sayin? , that's some old detroit shit
Y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though. less you come
To my city, ya know what'm sayin? see where we live,
Cause we shine
Chorus: 2x
[hush]
Mc's put detroit up in they rap songs
Cause without us there careers wouldn't last long
So like a generation we've been passed on
Now it's our time to shine, put your glasses on
Got these a & r's and labels with binoculars
Lookin in, jockin us and not jockin yours
Too many groups follow trends, unoriginal
Usin loops that transcend every bitch in you
Don't ever try to say this is a ghost town
One million rappers in this bitch, they need to slow down
Evualute the situation, all the rest are killers
Fly hoes out on jefferson with the drug dealers
Two years in the joint, nobody's touchin hush
Try to say you'll put us down, but your under us
Now who the fuck are you? it's just coincidental
When your rhyme your even worse than the instrumental
Your just a phone-tapper with no backbone
Talkin shit, I got a clique that only pack chrome
Have your ass gone, nowhere to run, when we hit
Next time you'll think twice of who you fuckin wit
Chorus: 3 and 1/4
[Intro:]
I can hear your heartbeat, your scared, yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat, your scared [x2]
You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I see, I come at night, boy, I kill you, you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry
Look look, I've come from a different crew
You fuck with me, I'll get to you
A clip or two, I'll cripple you
Just 'cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop, a pussy drop
Drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie miney moe
Nine, Trey Pound or 44
Pick a strap to take the Mac
The hawk I'll stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name
And where you rest, I'll make a mess
The hollow tips'll hit ya chest
You cough up blood to EMS
Come pick you up
You know you fucked when
You get on a strecther
'Cause I'll come in ICU
To see you off to heaven
The system out I done been through with
There's nothing new there to me
They locked me up they left me out
You seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals
Why they up in corrections
They come and get at 9
Nigga crown me a perfection
It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistic
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's going terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it
[Repeat Chorus:]
[Eminem:]
Man these are average raps
I'm keepin the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady aftermath clique
You pop off the top it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the octamom to death with a cabbage patch kid
Attack a snatch ya there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac 10s
Triplets quadruplets and a couple of back to back twins
That fetus is fallin out all over jack is back again
The rippers at your service
Girl I can see that your nervous
But I barely scratch the surface
Like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin backyard
Still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog,
How late you wanna stay out,
It's past your curfew when it's dark
I'm searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month
They found a coat all rolled up
Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace
No DNA no not a drop
Cause me and dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops
Grab the butcher knife from off the counter top
[Repeat Chorus:]
[Eminem:]
Yeah, I'm as I'll as can be
My appeal is to serial killers
What a pill is to me,
Killing so villainously,
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil going psycho
It's michael myers,
You know what were like on the muthafucking mic,
So try us and your gonna find out,
What the fuck were like with pliers,
[50 cent:]
It's operation time got em
Hooked up to wires,
Squeeze em, he bleeding, wheezing, breathing he half dead,
He must not know but now he now how Shady Aftermath is,
Even murderous tactics get better with practice,
Lead showers, gun powder, fill the tellers burn burn,
Truly ours Juliard, you better learn learn,
[Eminem:]
Chris Reeves in his grave,
Yeah homie turn turn,
I'm debating, mutilating the lady,
You've been waiting for shady and fif,
Ain't no duplicating it baby,
There's a baby in the drier,
There's a torso in the washer,
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her,
Arms and legs in the garbage cause the rest of her,
I lost her,
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her,
And put her through the ringer and hung her over the wash tub,
[50 Cent:]
When I'm through with Ricky it'll will be blood that'll cough up
A hard rock soft fuck [? ]
Get caught up and get washed up,
In Detroit or Northfolk,
When it's disrupt and nauseas,
Look deep in my eye and see many many many men die,
I swing gym stars faster than samurai,
In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it brighter
But arsenic writer, often with arthritis
Carpel-tunnel, Marshal with start shititis
Hard-headed and hot-headed, bull-headed and pig-headed
Dick-headed a brick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick with it for every lyric spit it
There are 6 critics who wait, for me to slip with it
So quit this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute, someone will tick
Lit it and its not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling I'll quit so, stop dwelling
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
'Cuz I got jelly, like jizzin on your pot belly
This is destiny, yes money, I'm off running, so get off of me
I'm not slowing the softening
No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
Till I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos, help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like affixation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating
Fuck yeah, I'm a basket case
And I mastered this rap shit till my ass gets wasted
Till my assassination
Till I'm slain 'cuz of some fags infatuation
.44 Mag's fascination
A taste for disaster and if that's the case then
No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
Till I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
I could spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies
This song isn't for you it's for me
A true MC, it's what I do just to see if he still has it
And if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed that's a
Real MC got you feeling me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger, and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast
If I ain't had this outlet to salvage me
Inside, I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing
And mourning so I'm warning you don't coax me
It's silly, but really its sheep in wolves clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed don't we
Fool, the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know' cuz they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking bout these tattoos cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out I'm sick of duking
They can suck my dick while I'm puking, and you too you can
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies

I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple 
I'm quick to murder ink with lead and talkin' bout a pencil
Lookit what the fuck you done got into 
I see you found yo niche, you just a bitch wit a menstrol
Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong 
You put 'e' before the 'd' 'cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a regular guy 
If Pac was still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real 
Life is more than imitating niggaz and eatin' pills
And kind of muthafucka ruins three deals 
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated 
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover 'cause he need it
And all you niggaz hatin', shut you mouths 
It's just that real niggaz ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out
[Obie Trice] 
Do-ra-mi, but we don't sing muhfuckas 
So Murder Inc. do ya thing muhfuckas
You've unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less 
Than R&B comin' from that regime
Regime It's a little extreme 
Neck and necks with soldiers, muhfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing 
We've eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green 
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a muthafuckin actor slash Pac impersonatin' rapper 
Slash Billie Holliday how it happen?
Artist for Repetuar saw him in action 
Pac assassination Def Jam grabbed him
Told him reinact him, you go platinum 
They seen it for sure, I know that Afina Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffery Atkins reinactin' her boy 
So I'm click-clackin' this toy
Bash and destroy, Shady
Aftermath and Detroit muthafuckas 
[Chorus]
[Eminem] 
Do-ra-me, fa-so-la-ti-da 
Don't blame me 'cause you lost your boss's spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa 
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
Don't make me, too hot and you're not 
Shootin' at me, with the only shot you got
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac 
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
[Verse 2]
[Kuniva] 
Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs 
To the greivance and the cryin' and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook you half of a half-way crook, get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late greal one 
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script 
before the guns stick to the clip, and Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin' old ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen 
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on 
Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch made man, now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a tyrannasaurus rex?
You niggaz can scream holler and curse 
Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta ya purse
[Proof] 
Slim did it simple to get at the wankstas 
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on 
But you ?? the ?? for sucking your ??
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz? 
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business you ain't caught the concept 
You talkin' nonsense to walk and find press
Contact was blown by Munsetta in The Source 
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on ya porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us 
But Detroit niggaz ?? and ain't scurred to bust
[Kon Artis] 
Word to my nigga Bugs, punks like you get beat up 
Stomped unconcious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillic Pac or that transvestite who dress like a Lil Kim fox, her chest like a little windbox 
press tight on the trigger of this glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat 
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video tryin mock Pac 
You 'Mockaveli', get your own identity 
[Chorus]
[Eminem overdubs chorus] 
Yeah! 
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again! 
Fuckin' punk pussy little bitch! 
I'll fuck you up boy! 
Never! Never in your muthafuckin life! 
I'll choke the shit outchu little muthafuckin bitch! 
Hailie can whip your muthafuckin ass!

[Screaming & Running]
[ Intro ] [ Eminem ]
Ballz, Ballz, Ballz x2
You'll never touch my...
[ Chorus ] [ Eminem ]
Catch me if you can but you ain't man enough, 
You're standin' tough
But you know that no matter what
You'll never get the chance to touch
My ballz, ballz, ballz x2
You'll never touch my ballz
[ Verse 1 ] [ Swifty McVay ]
I see you ain't a playa, you ain't ballin'
And I don't even care who the hell you call in
In this game, it ain't no talkin'
You can get it started, I nail the coffin
And all I here is "get your man up off him"
So why I gotta stop it, this nigga was talkin'
And I ain't gotta prove you nothin'
I do it and you ain't gotta push my buttons
[ Verse 2 ] [ Bizarre ]
This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick
He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit
So I played my position and don't make a move
Been doin' this for years, my team can't lose
And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard
9 o'clock, I'm gonna punch me a guard
Hut one, hut two, I'm ready
Hike, give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this 'fore you have to kill me
And any player in my way, I'm foldin'
Damn it, called holdin'
[ Chorus ] [ Eminem ]
[ Verse 3 ] [ Eminem ]
Football, Football, I love football
Yes, tres, dos, uno
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
That didn't work, try another play
Hut one, hut two, hut hut hurry up
I'm reachin' up another grown man's butt
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus yikes, I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah so are my balls
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus
Run it back, wrong song, yeah disreguard
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?
Our on 5 and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball
Down the sideline to Von, he steps outta bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle, we're down by six
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift
But he's so god dang high, that he trips
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put ???
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit I'ma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybody's laughin' now, no timeouts and its now fourth down
We're never gonna make it, wait I just got an idea
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long
I'ma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you wit no pants on
Ass out with a floppin' schlong, touch down yeah I told you....
It's the longest yard
[ Chorus ] [ Eminem ]
[ Verse 4 ] [ Kuniva ]
The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball
I'ma run through all of ya'll, ya'll just soft
Even though my cleats is kickin' up mud
It's more traction for me, I'm stiff armin' punks
High steppin' through the end zone
I been gone, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone
It's time to rumble, no time to fumble
And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble
Playin' ball with killas, my team's gorillas
Three time offenders, even drug dealers
One of the best runnin' backs there never was
Movin' like Barry Sanders, leavin' you in the dust
[ Verse 5 ] [ Proof ]
Yack is high, I got the highest yack
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snaps like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eyin' my eye, a Mack Truck tryin to sack us
No matter how big they flyin' backwards
Wide reciever, recievin' wide
For every stride in my life, I breathe and die
[ Verse 6 ] [ Kon Artis ]
Defense is playin' a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excell
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare
And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
Now I'm flyin' through the air like a superhero
I can use this pose for a box of cereal
I'm no joke punk, I get my dinerio
For bein' the best player on my team what
As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, hut
I do one run, run, the screen go run run
Then I cut, spin around in the endzone
Then I do the ninety shuffle so
[ Chorus ] [ Eminem ]
[ Outro ] [ Eminem ]
Footballs
I'm talkin' about footballs dude
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?
Hi kids, do you like violence?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails
Through each one of my eyelids?
(Uh, huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
(Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
(Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
(Umm)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead"
Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted
Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard
I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut
(Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
(Oww)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians
In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
(Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Aah)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away
(Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
(Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
(Hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
(C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me, mom?
(Wah)
You ain't got no tits
(Wah)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
(Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
[Rabbit]
Now everybody from the 313 
Put your mother fucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313 
Put your mother fucking hands upÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¦look, look
Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free world's got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1Pac, 2Pac, 3Pac, 4
4Pac, 3Pac, 2Pacs, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, Yo Pac; none
This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
I know everything he's bout to say against me,
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun,
I did get jumped, by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
Don't never try to judge me dude 
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter dawg, you embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster; his real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks'
He's scared to death, he's scared to look 
at his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook
Fuck a beat, I go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly 
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie, 
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me.
'When We're Gone' 
[D-Boi and New Shady Version]
D-Boi featuring New Shady and EMINEM
[Intro-D-Boi and New Shady]
Yo this is D-Boi and this song goes out to Ash 
I hope you still know I'll pay you a lot of cash
 [New Shady]
Yo and this song also goes 
Out to my girl- Ashley
 [Verse 1-D-Boi]
Have you ever felt for someone like you don't wanna leave 'em?
But you have to go 'cause you don't wanna hurt 'em 
'Cause people are tryin' to hurt you
You can't risk them hurtin' her too
you pack up and try to leave but hesitate
You know you gotta leave the fuckin' state
All cause a girl turned your ass down
You know you've gotta leave the fuckin' town
Then about a mile down the road you think
You can't go down wit your ship, you can't fuckin' sink
When you get home, your gun's on the ground you pick it up
You slip in a pool of blood and you can't get up
You think it's over, you think it's all your fault
Then you look up and see her picture on the wall
You get up and think this the last show, better show it all
That's D-Boi, yeah baby D-Boi's crazy
New Shady made me, but tonight D-Boi is rock-a-bye baby
[Chorus 2x-EMINEM and D-Boi]
And when we're gone, just carry on don't mourn,
rejoice every time you hear the sound of our voices
Just know that we're lookin' down on you smilin'
And we didn't feel a thing so people don't feel no pain, just smile back
[Verse 2-D-Boi]
You're drivin' down the road and you don't know where your goin'
You blacked out after that 40 ounces was fuckin' gone
But next thing you know, you wake up in cuffs
You look over and there's another pool of blood
You think to yourself, I actually did it
I killed a man for my fuckin' kid
Thank God I did
I couldn't take the shit
1 year later I wake up in prison
They tell me I'm out,
Thank your fuckin' spouse
I look up and I'm like holy shit
I'm married and didn't even know it
And then I am at a concert singin' with EMINEM and New Shady
And I tell them that Mary Beth's the person I wished was my lady
And then I look up and see you Mary Beth up in the crowd
I call out her name, but she doesn't hear a sound
It's because these damn people are screamin' so loud
I say up in my mind I'll always love, care, and treat you good lil sis 
And that's a promise
You're grown up and married to Chris
And just as I walk out the jail cell it turns to a stage they're gone
And the spotlight is on and EMINEM and me are singin'
[Chorus 2x-EMIENM and D-Boi]
And when we're gone, just carry on don't mourn,
rejoice every time you hear the sound of our voices
Just know that we're lookin' down on you smilin'
And we didn't feel a thing so people don't feel no pain, just smile back
[Verse 3-New Shady]
[D-Boi- yo give it up for yo boy New Shady]
I was in prison for someone I shot
Up in a parkin' lot
But I'm still here
I have two more years
Until I get released
Caught by the police
I love my wife, why would I hate her 
2 more years later
I'm out of prison
Was it a dream or all a vision
I call out to Ashley and she say's yes dear
I tell the kids and her to come over here
And then I tell her we're goin' for a ride
As long as we got each other by our a side
We'll be fine
And Ashley and me are out wit the kids
Ashley turns to me and walks up to me
And kisses me on the lips
This is the happiest day that I've ever had
D-Boi got released yesterday from prison and it made me mad
If something were to happen to Ashley or my kids I'd be there to protect 'em like a husband and a dad
[Chorus 2x-EMINEM and New Shady]
And when we're gone, just carry on don't mourn,
rejoice every time you hear the sound of our voices
Just know that we're lookin' down on you smilin'
And we didn't feel a thing so people don't feel no pain, just smile back
 [Verse 4-EMINEM, D-Boi, and New Shady]
[All]
Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seat, 
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at our feet,
We take a bow and, ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"thank you all for comin' outÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚,
They're screamin' so loud, we take one last look at the crowd
[D-Boi]
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein',
ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"Daddy it's me! Help mommy her wrists are bleedin'!ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?!
ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad, 
And I bought you this coin, 
It says "number 1 dad", that's all I wanted
I just wanna give you this coin, 
I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goingÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
[New Shady]
But baby wait-
ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"its too late dad, you made your choice. Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want
They want you Marshall, they keep 
screamin your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep.
Just take another, pill, yeah I bet ya you will
You rap about it. Yeah word, can't keep it realÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it, 
put it to my brain, scream 'die Shady!' and pop it 
The sky darkens, my life flashes, 
The plane that we were supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
[EMINEM]
That's when we all wake up, alarm clock's ringin',
There's birds singin', it's spring and
Hailie's out side swingin',
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say-
[Chorus 2x- D-Boi, New Shady, and EMINEM]
And when we're gone, just carry on don't mourn,
rejoice every time you hear the sound of our voices
Just know that we're lookin' down on you smilin'
And we didn't feel a thing so people don't feel no pain, just smile back

Ayo, before I start this song man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
And baring with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
Yeah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one
I went away I guess to open up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
What I was going through growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins
On the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him cause the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
Thank god that I didn't do it
I would of had my ass handed to me
And I knew it but Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying
Your health is declining with your self esteem, you're crying out for help
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin' self loathing and hollow
Bottoms up of pill bottle maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
But I must be talkin' to the wall though
I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater I've put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not a egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, it's startin' to bottle
Inside 'em, one foot on the brake one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writers block in the parking lot of Mc Donalds
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded you pouted long enough
It isn't them it's you you fuckin', baby
Quit worrying about what they do and do fuckin' Shady
I'm fucking going crazy
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one
So I pick myself off the ground and fuckin' slam before I drown
Hit my bottom so hard I bounce twice suffice this time around
It's different them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come up to make it up to you no more fucking around
I've got something to prove to fans I feel like I let em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you
For those of you who don't know
The new mes back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin' up, pullin' up, blowin' up, all over no mo
My life is no longer a movie but the shows aint over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie Weezy keep ya head up
TI keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up
Don't let up, just keep slayin' 'em
Rest in Peace to DJ AM 'cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one
So here it is, dang, this feels like I just woke up or somethin'
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, ma
Ay, yo, is anybody I thought about goin' at
'Twas never nothin' personal
'Cause of some shit I was goin' thru', it's everybody else
I'm back, ay, yo
Met a retarded kid named greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with the peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty
Mix it with alka seltzer and formula 44-d
Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas
Cross the bombest
We blowing up your house
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus's
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted corvettes
On Vietnam war vets
I am more or less sick in the head
Maybe more
Because I smoked crack today, yesterday,
And the day before sabateur
Walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more straps than el salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on al b. sure
A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on records
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do it in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why? 'Cuz I'm a
Criminal
Criminal
You goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's, "Yes"
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin'
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get a hold of 'em
Hey, it's me, Versace
Whops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail
Get it? Checkin' the 'male'?
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon, relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an Amen
Amen
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards
Who?
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. "Don't Give A Fuck" still won't leave
I'm a criminal
'Cuz every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal
'Cuz every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one
My mother did drugs, tar, liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word
My morals went when the president got oral sex
In his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white
Blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
The maniac's in
Replacin' the doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal
Aight look
Uh huh
Just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfuckin' money
And get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waitin' on you
Aight
Yo, Em
What?
Don't kill nobody this time
Aw right, goddamn, fuck
Hi
How you doin'?
How can I help you?
Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fuckin' money in the bag, bitch
And I won't kill you
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
Just don't kill me, I have two kids at home
I said, I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you
Don't kill me
Hurry the fuck up
Thank you
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask
I'm a criminal
'Cuz every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal
'Cuz every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal
'Cuz every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
I don't gotta say a word

And put a hole in you, hole in you
I got places to go, I got people to see
The penitentiary, ain't the place for me

You mistaken me for somebody that you should be testin'
Your should be stressin' up, I'm gonna fuckin' teach you a lesson
Mac 101's in session and lace the track that I'm blessin'
Smith and Wesson's, the weapon, in case you just guessing
  (God damn)
These straight busters kept-in, kept-in my Benz, hop-in the end's
Watch the 22 spin , my hoe's they perfect 10
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherfuckers they thought I wouldn't win, pretend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best don't you get it, forget it, when I spit it, it's crazy
You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, it's Shady
Aftermath in your ass bitch, if it's not a classic
When it's dumped we trash it, so I got it mastered
Stop and get your ass kicked, bastered, when measures get drastic
Glock made out of plastic, cock-it aim it blast it, run nigga I'll stash it
I got places to go, I got people to see
The penitentiary, ain't the place for me

I got places to go, I got people to see
The penitentiary, ain't the place for me

There is a Genie in that bottle of that Dom Perignon
I'm a drink till I get to that bitch 'em and dre
Introduce me to the burbs they gonna listen to my words
In the hood they feel my shit
(Break-it down)
Picture a perfect picture, picture me in the paper
Picture me startin' shit, picture me bustin' my gat
Picture police man they ain't gotta picture of that
Picture me bein' broke, picture me smokin' a sack
Picture me comin' up, picture me rich from rap
Picture me blowin' up, now picture me goin' back
To my momma basement to live, shit, picture that
Where I'm from it's a fact, you gotta watch your back
You wear a vest without a gatt, you'se a target Jack
Hastle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, crew are back
50 Cent, too much spent? Man I'm bent, I'm outta here
I got places to go, I got people to see
The penitentiary, ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you do, not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze

Ha-ha
Man I ain't goin' to jail
Not even to visit a nigga
You want to holla at me, you wright me
Matter a fact, you gotta send it to sunset boulevard
In Montreal
Ha-ha-ha
Ridin' around in one of dre's Farrari's nigga
Or matter a fact I might be in detroit
Riding down 8 mile road
You know, for one of them en-joints and shit
Ha-ha
Ya heard, I got place to go man
You know, Shady,Aftermath
We finished our print money
Puttin' our faces on this motherfuckin' bill thug shit
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ain,t shit you can do 'bout it
Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check one two, we recordin'?
I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death then I choked you again
Then break your fuckin' legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef wit me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat yer ass legally
I get you blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
Ohh no, so if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads
Every girl I ever went out wit is goin' lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed 'em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
Witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed
A main vein' with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sighed, either I'm high, or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me
Back when Andre the giant, mister elephant tusk, 
Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust. 
Just one of, my mothers son who got thrown under the bus. 
Kiss my butt, Lick frumunda cheese from under my nuts. 
It disgusts, me to see the game the way that it looks. 
Its a must, I redeem my name n' haters get mushed. 
Bitch-s lust, Man they love me when I lay in the cut. 
Fist the cut, The lady give her eighty some paper cut. 
Now picture us, Its ridiculous you curse at the thought, 
Cuz when I spit the verse the sh-t gets worse then Worcestershure sauce. 
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time. 
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes. 
Its elementary, The elephants have entered the room. 
I venture to say we're the center of attention its true. 
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal, 
Of the bat symbol, The platinum trio's back on you hoes.
* Fart sounds
[Eminem](Redman)
Yo
(Yo)
Look!
(Yo)
[Eminem]
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep rapping this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gon' keep doing my thing
One of the worst things yo I am a fag  i suck at rapin yo
Is fat, bald men decided to write songs
And teach Mouseketeers to sing
I'll stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck
Club and swear at Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
(Bitch!)
You aware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled up his pants
Got a habit of holding Tylenol in his hands
Till it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
(So who is it?)
The fool who visits the playground
With two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pissed with a whip with a Marseburg
With a pistol grip and fed pit bull shit
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits
If I get too rich I just get sued
[Redman]
Yo I leave with no engine
After I blow four in ya
One handstand on top of your ninja
Crashin' Doc stir the madness
We all out of work like Tony Atlas
Walking with cans in a laundry basket
America's most with the army after us
Fuck flossin' we take what's yours
Unload fifteen like an ace and four
I'm out of work but Doc laid them off
(Shit! The power's out)
The tape is off
Yo who target it from arsonists?
Paper make pens filled with arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc can shave up, cut your barber miss
?
I turn out camps in to crystal lakes
And fuck bitches face is what I'mma do
Cause that's what white boy Tyno do
[Eminem]

Rip your lips off kiss my ass with it
Slap bitches, Doc, Marshall Maths..
(Print it!)
We ex and ass of tabs did it
I'm what's happening with no rerun
Doc rob Dinero when the heat come
My barrel hangs out the Camero
Aimed at the nose when them hoes is hard to breathe from
Flash the gat your town bow guarded
Your wallet, your chain the main target
Beef is like cold engine, don't start it
Bust in the air and hit an airplane pilot
We pound you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten speed and brown shoe
Doc and Eminem, cock the M&M
Blood flows with 2Paclypse and them
It's like Funk Doctor
[Eminem]
Mr. Punk Rocker
Got the drug stock inside the lunch box
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Pop the trunk and pull out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good
Thank God for vodka
But with my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker
Probably got a Fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
With an automatic calling me up there
My man Stan with a gat in his hand
Staking my house out in a damn tinted Sedan
Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn
Ham sandwich or your canned spinach or Spam
You gotta sip through a straw
Shop lift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey ma maybe I'll give you a call
SIKE! YOU FUCKING BITCH!
Suck a dick and two balls
I'm giving you all my shocking script 
Which is to piss a priest off with this
Pop more pills than police officers
Arrive at the scene to pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all
Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well be a painting smashed on the floor
[Redman]
So how's everybody feeling tonight?
Hope you in the mood to get rude
And illin' to fight
Cause uh we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump

Yeah, its a toast to the boogie baby, uhh, to the boogie oogie oogie
Yeah, yknow! What's crackin' Dre?
Just let me lay back and kick some mo simplistic pimp shit
On slims shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on guilty conscience at concerts
And watch moshpits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when its packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and snoop draw  is niggaz from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggaz again
These grown ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me?
D R E and shady, with Doggy from Long Beach
Came a long way, to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz, and I carry it all day
Sometimes its like a nightmare, just bein' Andre
But I
Somehow, someway, tell 'em, nigga, you know about Dogg-ay
Now let me cut these niggaz up and show em where da fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin' son
Hit and run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns, and I love all of em the same bang, bang!
Damn, baby girl, whats your name?
I forgot  what'd you say it was? Damn a nigga buzzed
Hangin' in the club, with my nephew Eminem whattup 'cuz?
The great white American hope, done hooked up
With the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, bay bay!
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
I'm the head nigga in charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with god
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
Its like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the body bag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with puff
Bitch, please you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, c'mon
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat

Aw naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up, in the, heezy bay bay
He's sha-day, he's so cra-zay!
Hahaha! gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the inter scope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal, makin' a living
Off of the worlds misery, what in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down, theres a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
Its just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you fagot, you happy now? Look here
I start some trouble everywhere that I go
(That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know
('Cause they know)
I start some shit they throw me out the back do
(The back do)
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo fo
(A fo fo)
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me

Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg
X to the Z, Nate Dogg
C'mon, yeah!
Okay, guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop, pajama time
Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's okay
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl

Oh baby
(Ah ah)
It's Friday and it's my day
Used to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?
Man you must be up out yo mind
Dre, ah, ah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby (ah ah)
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' "Ah ah ah ah"
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said. "Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's '8 Mile' now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit
Oh you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba
I don't have any lines to go right here so tubba
Tellytubby fellas, what, fellas, what
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous what
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'
It's the season, just go ah ah ah ah, it's so appeasin'
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl

Life.. by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the d*** ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret indentities
and disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing a** snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR s*** when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bulls*** without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherf*****s spraying s*** and dartin off
I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a d*** brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my d***
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough *** for the whole world to kiss
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of f*****g the same blonde wh*** after work
in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same d*** Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J-L-B saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a d*** brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my d***
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough a** for the whole world to kiss
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bulls***
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see s*** positive?
Know what I'm sayin?
I rap about s*** around me, s*** I see
Know what I'm sayin? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin?
Just fed up
That's my word
[T.I]
Now I don't really care what you call me
just as long as you dont call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
streets like cold Chicago
aint nothing knew I've seen it all before
but still I ball like no tomorrow
goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote
all she wrote, all she wrote
I said it's over with thats all she wrote
all she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight its over with...
[T.I]
(?) sewing up the game, strong like they hate me for it
Eventually see they cant beat than with me they join
others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
you tell lies, get caught, n-gga kick rocks
you never did blend in with the big shots
its on the fast track, aint no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, n-gga wishing it was this hot
guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off
better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
catch me in the end zone
high stepping prime time
thought you n-ggas been on
aint no blocking my shine
like my new air Yeezy's, you can see me in the night
you wanna hate, have a nice time
while I get stupid paper, hey my dough aint in its right mind
(mind, mind)
[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
just as long as you dont call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
streets like cold Chicago
aint nothing knew I've seen it all before
but still I ball like no tomorrow
goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote
all she wrote, all she wrote
[Eminem]
Man, tip toe me on this whole tip
last tip I could give you to hip you was
never let these traits trick you
mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, sh-t
dig you a hole, take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
sh-t you talk about some adivce that sticks with you
if i should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
like double-stick, its you but f-ck 'em TIP, its cold
its chilling like and feeling like the penguin in it's f-cking igloo eating farcicals
I'd rather slip and fall in sh-t than fall in love with you
before I tie a f-cking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how f-cking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump somes with you
so here's a penny for your thoughts
but it won't buy you a chesseburger, but a nickle might just get you one pickle
f-ck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
thats a bombshell, scud missle!
I got to cuss with you to f-cking cuss at you
right before I rapped I was a mother-f-cking stud
slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way
buzh-shizzle, I still live like a budget?, hey gill its
(?)
[Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches know as soon as they saw me
its never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
still I ball like there's no tomorrow
[T.I]
(?)
But don't get mad at me
go blame the chick who wrote this shit
ya life is sure a bitch
but she know I'm rich
that why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
here I go again,
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
pay some euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon be poor again
see me posted in anything, wearing any chain
never gon see me toting anything
all you gon see is BANG!
its so nice where I kick it,
hate you never get to visit
yeah I'm on another level
but you n-ggas still can get it
its all over 'fore you finish
sorry bro this road we end it
wont give you the satisfaction 
of me giving you the (?)
[Eminem]
Yeah I guess life is a b-tch, aint it Tim,
(?)
I said off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now,
but in case you didnt
this is so bad, stick a nose to your forehead and staple it
life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
so I pace this shit a little bit quicker
that clock comer racing in double time
but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
it may take you pricks to catch on
while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
man I still say K-mart like theres an apostrophe "S" on it dog
and they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
but if you gon tell me that the A&W aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg
[Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
[T.I]
I bet thye knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight it's over with, thats all she wrote
all she wrote, all she wrote
[Eminem]
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Good night is over with thats all she wrote
[T.I]
all she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
I said its over with
thats all she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
[Intro: x2]
I done figured this rap shit out
I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
And order the mask til they want a war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared em off, there are no more
Victims to stick I'm fixin to pick some and start shit
I'm outta [repeat]
Pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat em to death, Benzino went deaf
There seems to just be no one left to bully
Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush?
Puss is bushy
Ain't shit goin on, shit I been gettin so bored lately
I'm thinkin of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then
Shit I could spit better, I'm bout to kick this sick shit again, look
The game just isn't the same, it's changin
Shit Dre's quittin, Jay'z quittin, now it's just gangstas just sayin the same shit
It's ancient, it's fakin
It's makin me so bored, I'mma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human I'm a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber
You think I'm a nuisce, I'm impressive I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
(Na na na nah na na nah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo, never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta till I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
Never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see, if it's true, if it's you
What you say In your raps, what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation
Any hesitation will get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, if you conceal it, reveal it
Bein' reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I love pissin' you off, hits me off, like my lawyers
When the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckas gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bring it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers, six-two, who needs bullets?
Soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out to the hot rocks parkin' lot
You'll all get shot, whether its your fault or not, 'cuz
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckas could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch
So ticky tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
Till the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that adverse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, I'm a
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
  (I'm a soldier)
I'm a soldier
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
  (I'm a soldier)
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
  (I'm a soldier)
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
  (I'm a soldier)
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
  (I'm a soldier)
Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left
  (I'm a soldier)
Yo, I got an idea
Let me go grab sticky right quick
Hey yo, stick, stick
Yo, Slim Shady
Yo, I just had like a nightmare
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah
Well it wasn't a good
What was it?
Hey,  I just had a crazy dream man
What? I dreamed I was white
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white
White, white, white, white?
Yo, yo
What if I was white
Skin the same color as Eminem?
The whole shibang
I know one thing
Police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothin'
Constantly jockin' me
Yellow cabs in the cities would stop for me
I wouldn't need caladeral to buy property
If I was white
Wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
Security wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something
Because I'm black I rob
And automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white
I wouldn't thought O.J. was innocent
If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white, white
White, white, white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white
White, white, white, white?
If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white
White, white, white, white?
If I was white
It would be a different world for me
If I was white?
What shade would I be?
Would I be redneck or skinhead
Preppy or high class?
You'd probably live in a trailerpark
And be white trash
In any case that be the ill shit right?
But there's a good and a bad side to being white
You can't say the N word without starting a fight
Couldn't dance on beat, I'd had two left feet
Even if I was white
I'd still have a ghetto chick
Is it a myth or would I really have a little dick
If I was white
I would probably listen to hard rock
And cover my ears when ever I heard hip hop
If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white
White, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white
White, white, white, white?
If he was white
I'd probably wouldn't even think the same
I'd watch tennis and golf
And bet on hockey games
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
And would probably wouldn't
Nver even been an Onyx
I be steady sippin' vodka and tonixs
Smokin' on a Marlboro
Instead of a nNewport
I'd live in Long Island
Instead of New York
If I was white
I probably couldn't dunk
'Cause everybody knows white man can't jump
I probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spots
'Cause all the dreads would think I'm a cop
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white
White, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white
White, white, white, white?
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white
White, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white
White, white, white, white?
Yeah, yeah
Tricky
Let's show 'em some love
Welcome to Detroit
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs

I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit, Trick Trick
Quick come pick me up, bring them guns
Come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk 'cuz he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
'Cuz uh, somethin' smells a lil' fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie come get me, Chedda boys what up though I see you

I said, "Welcome to Detroit City"
Every place, everywhere we go

Homie, it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
Marshall done called me to 54 and laced the track
This the beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Squad
And gangsta been bangin' the underground since '95, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit City
I said, "Welcome to Detroit City"
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good man they all say Tricky
Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons, come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie, I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can fear me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit City
I said, "Welcome to Detroit City"
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good man they all say Tricky
Yeah, Trick Trick

Damn right, I said my nigga

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aide who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan, an ex Heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music
Told me she was goin' back into usin' again
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than Heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here"
Who's in the den?
It's me and Kelly
My bad, let's try another room
I don't trust you
Shut up slut!
Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt naked, and run in the woods
Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab
Oh dag!
What?
I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag
Huh?!
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
Yo Sue!
Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's trippin'
I need to go puke
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop cryin', I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out
She said, "Help me I think I'm havin' a seizure!"
I said, "I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin' my Tshirt"
"Would you calm down you're startin' to scare me"
She said, "I'm twenty six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook"
I'm over here Sue, You're talkin' to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital before it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat
As many mushrooms as you ate
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
Susan, wait! Where you goin'? You better be careful
Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin' to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
Before you do somethin' dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these
John, where's Dave at before I bash you
He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap dude
"Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin' to plants
Choppin' her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?
Well it depends on how may you had
I took 3, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinkin' Lysol
She's gonna die dude
I know and it's my fault!
My God!
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
My God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
Susan please wake up!
Please, Please wake up
What are you doing?
You're not dead! You're not dead!
I know you're not dead
Oh my God!
Wake up, Susan wake up
Oh my God!
Yo, yeah girl
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you?
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep
'Round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums, oh look, here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©t Ramsey
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
And when we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box)
So if you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me
(My music box)
So when she twirls around and do a whirl for me
(My music box)
Won't you be my private little dancer?
(My music box)
I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober? Gross!
I foam like a doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's make-up, get naked, and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
And when we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box)
So if you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me
(My music box)
So when she twirls around and do a whirl for me
(My music box)
Won't you be my private little dancer?
(My music box)
I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's
Neck like a pixie stick the sick Satan worshippin'
Bitches get horse-whippin's, I'm in the back
Through the back door, slippin' through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above forced
And treat 'em all when cheat them all, stingy I've become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in, slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like
"Tabatha, I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya"
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
And when we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box)
So if you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me
(My music box)
So when she twirls around and do a whirl for me
(My music box)
Won't you be my private little dancer?
(My music box)
Is this thing on? Where'd everybody go?
Guess who's back? Back again
Ken is back, tell some men
Rub my back, rub my back, rub my back, rub my back
Eh, wait hello? Eh, goodnight
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you
I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
And in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel dissin' again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I can't just sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like
To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others' eyes
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check
The temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
And so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door
For conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Ha! Marshall you're so funny man
You should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like
To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
Every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
And Edna always told me
Keep making that face and it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue tryna talk like that
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
'Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like
To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you
Yeah, to my babies
Stay strong, daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let anyone tell you you ain't beautiful
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless 
Patrolling corners 
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters 
I'm meaner in action 
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer (?) 
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments 
I grew up in the wild hood 
As a hazardous youth 
With a fucked up childhood 
That I used as an excuse 
And aint shit changed 
But kept the same mindstate 
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade 
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it 
I don't promote violence I just encourage it 
I laugh at the sight of death 
As I fall down a cement flight of steps 
And land inside a bed of spider webs 
So throw caution to the wind 
You and a friend 
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again 
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out 
I'm blowing mine out 
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now 
It's only fair to warn 
I was born with a set of horns 
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord 
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board 
That smashed into your Honda Accord 
With a 4 door Ford 
But a more toward (?) droppin an accapella 
The choppin a fella into motzerella
Worse than a hellacopta propella 
Got you locked in the cella 
With your skeleton showing 
Developing anorexia 
While I'm standin next to ya 
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death 
With an IV in your veins 
Feeding you liquid darvicet 
Pumping you full of drugs 
Pull the plugs 
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs 
Who were picked up in an ambulance 
And driven 
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants 
And given 
A less than 20 percent chance 
Of living 
Have a possible placement 
It's a hospital patient 
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement 
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived 
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!" 
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp 
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth 
Better call the fire department 
I've hired a arson 
To set fire to carpet 
And burn up your entire apartment 
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick 
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit 
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg 
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg 
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40 
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D 
Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead 
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead 
No more said case closed end of discussion 
I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion 
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas 
Cross the bombas (?) 
We blowin up your house killing your parents 
and coming back to get your foster mommas 
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus 
Cause I aint making no more threats 
I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets 
I'm more or less sick in the head 
Maybe more cause I smoked crack (?) 
today, yesterday, and the day before Savator
Walk the block with a labrador 
Strapit corral with war more than El Salvador
Foul style galore 
Verbal cow manure 
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure 
yo yo yo, my mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp 
for a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand 
two dudes ran up who jumped out of a blue van 
i looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch 
i swung it at the first dude 
the other one hit em 
seen it snap so fast it look like it broke before it hit him 
so he tried to rush 
i swept his legs, pinned him and bit him 
he came back with sticks and seven dudes screamin "GET HIM" 
i grabbed one, lit him on fire pinned him and bit him 
the next one, gave me his shoes like the didnt fit him 
one by one i just kept droppin them in a rhythm 
then i woke up, swingin in the middle of the kitchen 
Damn
It's okay, it's okay, nothin' can get in the way
Sometimes, I just feel like quitting, I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes, it's hard enough just dealin' wit real life
Sometimes, I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skills like
But I'm still white, sometimes, I just hate life
Something ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Uh, da, da, da, da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been ripped
So, I must then get, off the bus then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 mile road
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
  (8 mile road)
And I'm gone, I know right where I'm going
Sorry Mama, I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't follow no footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road
I'm walking these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Mommas got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors, her big brother, her mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the Daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from something I never wanted so bad
Sometimes, I get upset 'cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressures too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homey, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother, I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never to far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way that I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 mile road
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
  (8 mile road)
And I'm gone, I know right where I'm going
Sorry Mama, I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't follow no footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't? It still is
To be walkin' this boarder line of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate of authenticity
You've never even seen
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smelled, or met a real MC
Who's incredible up on the same pedestal as me
But yet still unsigned, having a rough time
Sit on the porch wit all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
'Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit, so fuck it
Maybe, I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical, who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the salvation army, tryin' to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
Plus, I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up and one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun and it's so dark
Sometimes, I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes, I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin' I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes, my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no falling, no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders, I'm three in the third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
  (8 mile road)
And I'm gone, I know right where I'm going
Sorry Mama, I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't follow no footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road
(I never knew I)
(I never knew I)
Mic check, one two
(I never knew I)
Who woulda knew?
(I never knew I)
Who'da known?
(I never knew I)
Fuck, what a story
(I never knew I)
Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I)
And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I)
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I)
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk, when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out, and turn 'em around
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
But don't blame me, when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents
'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row
Screamin, "Go", with their seventeen year old uncle
I'm like, "Guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked, if they liked violence?"
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make up you allow, your twelve year old daughter to wear?
So tell me, that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
And 'Fuck' was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every three months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?
'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch, I never knew I'd
Have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby de doo wop
Skibbedy be bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin' some trees
How many retards'll listen to me?
And run up in the school shootin'
When they're pissed at a teach
Her, him, is it you, is it them?
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought?
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not
'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
How the fuck was I supposed to know?
hey yo Paul
Its Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing, and I know that he's not thrilled about the video.
What does he want to be starting something?
yeeeeaaaah well i'll show him who's really bad (burps)
Paul, the way you make me feel with these calls you should really take a look at the man in the mirror and tell him to beat it because i won't stop til I get enough
Do you remember that time we were watching the Billie Jean video
Well he'll always be that Michael to me and it doesnt matter if he's black or white because i can't stop loving him and i hate plastic surgeons and i hope they all fucking dieeeee.
how do you like that?
man i like him...
i like him a lot...
i want to touch him...
but i can't...
llluuuuoooowwwwwuuuww (noises)

anyways call me back because i have this idea about how i want to end the show...
so hit me when you get this messege.... fuuucker
oh and by the way, no, i dont have a new gun...
(gun cocks) god damn it.
[Intro- 50 Cent]
Sh Sh...Shady Aftermath HaHa
G G G-Unit! HaHa
[Chorus- Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game
Without atleast sayin good-bye
So all my people on my left
All my people on the right swing one last time
Get ya ass up for the doctor
One more time get ya ass up for the doctor
Come on now here we go cliff hanger
It's another club banger got ya hangin on the edge of ya seat
Get on down
[Verse 1]
[Dr. Dre]
Time's up game's over you lose I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yea new year next phase begin
Look who's got you goin crazy again
I'm a trend I set one everytime I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you're somethin that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
[Eminem]
Too bad you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip we out grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
Sittin observed, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
While 10 multi-platinum albums lay the three diamond
World wide we on the charts with a bullet we're still flyin
[Chorus- Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game
Without atleast sayin good-bye
So all my people on my left
All my people on my right swing one last time
When Dr. Dre says crunk you will get it crunk
Get it crunk (Crunk crunk crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump
You get on one foot and
 
50 Cent:
Jump, jump 
Eminem:
Jump, jump
[Verse 2]
[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous we drop you all just sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know the Doc is off the benches
[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin off the hinges
We ain't showin off, we just goin off popular concensus
[Dr. Dre]
But critics say the Doc is soft, Doc is talk
The Doc is all washed up knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin
Doc is this Doc is that you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc 'cause Doc left you all guessin
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record
We gonna have this mothafucka hoppin in a second (bump, bump!)
Thats why we always save the best cut last
To make a scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
[Eminem]
Cause we done swam with the sharks wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers 
Whom if it wasnt for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
who may have never got to see our faces,
Graced the cover of Rolling stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races,
just call on the cape crusaiders
and leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day like the hot potato game
Thats why we came to...
[Chorus- Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off right 
Llet's bounce tonight

[Verse 3]
[50 Cent]
Bounce now hands up you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret everybody know when Dre's involved
There's plenty money involved
[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honies involved and sunny sunday's and palm trees
Cali everyday is just another party from the valleys
[Dr. Dre & Eminem]
All the way to them 8 mile alleys
[Eminem]
Let's ralley hands up for the grand finale now raise up out your seat

You can catch me in the studio bangin out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin out your speaker
[Eminem]
So never say never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit records presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence of the
[Chorus- Eminem]
We came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight

Without atleast sayin good-bye
So all my people on my left
All my people on my right swing one last time

[Vesre 1]
[Swift] 
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple 
I'm quick to murder ink with lead and i aint talkin' bout a pencil
Lookit what the fuck you done got into 
I see you found yo niche, you just a bitch wit a menstrol
Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong 
You put 'e' before the 'd' 'cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy 
If Pac was still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real 
Life is more than imitating niggaz and eatin' pills
And kind of muthafucka ruins three deals 
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated 
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover 'cause he need it
And all you niggaz hatin', shut you mouths 
It's just that real niggaz ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out
[Obie Trice] 
Do-ra-mi, but we don't sing muhfuckas 
So Murder Inc. do ya thing muhfuckas
You've unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less 
Than R&B comin' from that regime
Regime its a little extreme 
Neck and necks with soldiers, muhfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing 
Weave eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green 
Don't fuck with them triple beams
You's a muthafuckin actor slash Pac impersonatin' rapper 
Slash Billie Holliday how it happen?
Artist for Repetuar saw him in action 
Pac assassination Def Jam grabbed him
Told him reinact him, you go platinum 
They seen it for sure, I know that Afina Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffery Atkins reinactin' her boy 
So I'm click-clackin' this toy
Mash and destroy, Shady slash
Aftermath and Detroit muthafuckas 
[Chorus]
[Eminem] 
Do-ra-me, fa-so-la-ti-da 
Don't blame me 'cause you lost your boss's spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa 
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
Don't make me, too hot and you're not 
Shootin' at me, with the only shot you got
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac 
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
[Verse 2]
[Kuniva] 
Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs 
To the greivance and the cryin' and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook you half of a half-way crook, get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one 
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script 
before the guns stick to the clip, and Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin' old ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen 
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on 
Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch made man, now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a tyrannasaurus rex?
You niggaz can scream, holler and curse 
Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta ya purse
[Proof] 
Slim did it simple to get at the wankstas 
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on 
Put your ear to the ground for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz? 
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business you ain't caught the concept 
You talkin' nonsense to walk and find press
Contact was blown by Munsetta in The Source 
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on ya porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us 
But Detroit niggaz servin and ain't scurred to bust
[Kon Artis] 
Word to my nigga Bugs, punks like you get beat up 
Stomped unconcious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillic Pac or that transvestite who dress like a Lil Kim fox, her chest like a little windbox 
press tight on the trigger of this glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat 
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video tryin mock Pac 
You 'Mockaveli', get your own identity 
[Chorus]
[Eminem overdubs chorus] 
Yeah! 
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again! 
Fuckin' punk pussy little bitch! 
I'll fuck you up boy! 
Never! Never in your muthafuckin life! 
I'll choke the shit outchu little muthafuckin bitch! 
Hailie can whip your muthafuckin ass! 
[Obie Trice speaking] 
That's right muthafuckas 
Shay records, whatchu know about it? 
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule 
Nigga, this Obie Triceright here talkin to you muthafuckas 
Ja Rule punk ass... Yea! 
Fuckin Soul For Real ass... 
Nigga that's Soul For Real, 
That the nigga from Soul For Real! 
Candy Rain ass nigga... 
He got a deal now he rappin' 
You'ont know what's... faggot ass muhfuckas 
Get money to all my real niggas, man 
Obie Trice, D12, G Unit, 50 Cent... 
Hailie Jade!!! 
[50 Cent (laughing)]
[Hailie] 
Daddy is Ja Rule taller than me? 
[Eminem] 
No honey, you guys are the same size...
Bad Boy baby
Yeah, yeah
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah
Yeah, B.I.G. 2000
B.I.G. 2000 born again, c'mon
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace, smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha?  I'm out like, 'The Vapors'
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up niggaz need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor, and me hittin' the clits
Suckin' on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was 'Humpin' Around' and 'Jump-in Around'
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man, she said, "B.I.G"
Then I bust in her E Y E
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis after she sucked the dick
I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya till you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin'
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin' horse's heads
Human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals havin' sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit
I just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin', I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dyin' to cock him, he's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any fagot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wet on the third, then she's dead on the fourth
I'm dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, alright, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, I'm gonna lay the chorus first
Here we go now
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
My mom, my mom
I know you're probably tired of hearin' about my mom
Oh ho, whoa, ho, but this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Valium
Valium was in everythin', food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So everyday I had at least three stomach aches
Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
"What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?"
"Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer"
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a tea cup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
"Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner"
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints did I?
Now here's a plate full of pain killers
Now just wait till I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes"
"You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there
And make that retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put your face in it before I throw you in the basement again"
"And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there in one fuckin' place
Spinnin' again till next Thanksgivin'
And if you still ain't finished it, I use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip, it will be placed into shit"
"You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent
A rack fell and hit me at K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't slipped us shit
And so what if he did that, it's none of your dang business, kid"
My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom
I know that I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high but I'm high on
'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
My mom loved Valium
Now all I am is a party animal
I am what I am but I'm strong to be finished
Wit' me Valium spinach
But my buzz only last about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my valium
Man, I never thought that I could ever be a drug addict
Nah, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin', a tragedy
Fuckin' passin' it up, catchin' me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals to the bomb, I'm beautiful
Secure the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
"Here, want a snack, you hungry, you fuckin' rat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap
Eat it", "But I don't need it", "Well, fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up"
"All right, Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'"
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, drip then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Sorry Mom, I still love you though
Dr. Dre, 2010, hey, this shit is hella hard, homie
Yo, take us on outta here
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people
And five I hit, ah, shit
I started a moshpit, squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon, bounce, I said, c'mon, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb to gas your town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch before she passes out
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid, 'cos the X is gone
Yeah, I took 'em all down with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb
Young, dumb and fulla cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
You scary ass it was false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
So stop acting stupid, you so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shit, I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills and green
Big pills, mescaline
(That's ill)
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk
I wanna, roll away like a Rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for coke to smoke
No, oki dok
I pack up my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby
Born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
(You're crazy)
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
You got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs
'Cos our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack then I might too
(Swift, chill)
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue
Speed, shrooms, down the Valium
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and I'm going back soon
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I'm at a rave, looking like a slave
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy
Heroine mescaline, pencil legs wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill, bitch I'm for real
(Yeah, right)
Shut your mouth, you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Bizarre nut
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno
Fuck it
Uhh, hell yeah man, hm, oh fuck, yeah
When I'm not at home, beating my shit to death
I'm listening to the Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff, and I'm still mad as hell, fuck you
I'm crazy with this razor, with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed, I'm crazy
(Okay I'm reloaded)
Go bring Jay-Z
(Tell them him I'ma ghostwrite for him)
Over Dre's beats
Ran in the ladies room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it
(Ahh)
Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank
At the clerk and handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her
But I didn't take nothing
(Thanks)
Every bullet came from the same gun
Just from different angles
'Cuz I was pickin' strange places to aim from
(Man, I bet you 50 bucks you won't jump out the window, Shady)
(Ahh)
Pay me
Psych, no way fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister 'cuz I caught them in bed
(Wait, wait, wait)
I'm a crazy mothafucka, might shoot me a fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go
I go loco, see me pumpin' gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro mixed with cocoa
Jump turnstyles, then run from po po
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck, son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is
(Crazy)
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck, son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is
(Crazy)
Yo, yo, I wish I'd been aborted
My pockets got a shortage
Everything I wanna floss I can't afford it
I'm tryin' to sell a O', my pops tryin' to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad 'cuz I still stand in line for clubs
Mad 'cuz my rottweiler still shits on the rugs
(God dammit, Spike)
Feeling kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim Shady gave me shrooms and I might trip out, like
(Eh, oh Dude, that shit's crazy man, ohh, this is incredible, ohh)
Fuck that, Slim, keep that for yourself
You a crazy white dude and you need some help, word
I got a beautiful wife, kids and a gorgeous home
What would make jump in the tub with a cordless phone?
I'm straight vicious, I hit you with plates and dishes
Leave you eight stitches, what I'm gay 'cuz I hate bitches?
Slut don't be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And I'll still be mad at the world, even if it apologized to me
(Sorry)
You're hearing the last thoughts of a man
About to blow his fuckin' brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse
Spread out on a blood stained couch
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturin' Michael Jackson
In little boys' drawers shoppin' at toy stores
Shady said it, Shady meant it, I stay demented
I'll throw a stroller at you, with a baby in it
Go ahead, pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fuckin' pill mom, don't vacuum
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck, son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is
(Crazy)
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck, son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is
(Crazy)

No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, destroy you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
*Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound*
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
Sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off

Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks for second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Then quit bringin my flos, quit giving me my ammo
Can't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my ammo
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
Am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more?
Hailey:
Dad
Chorus
Verse #3:
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
So what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,
Cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd gank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
Like r kelly as soon as "bump n' grind" comes on
More pain inside o' my brain, in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the world trade, standin' on ronny's grave,
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather as clyde mathers and bonnie jade
And nash briddy musta just stop it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heater's desk, and two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither
Chorus
Outro:
Eminem:
Crazy
Hailie:
*laughs*
You're funny daddy!
People, it feels so good to be back
Mosh with me now
You scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'ma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a father-less past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin' and jugglin' both
Perhaps mastered his craft slash entrepreneur
Who has helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure
Movin' past that Mr. 'Kiss his ass crack'
He's a class act, rubber band man yeah, he just snaps back
Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
Come on
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form this stomp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
No matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same 'cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now, more then ever
They tell us, "No", we say, "Yeah", they tell us, "Stop", we say, "Go"
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, c'mon, just
Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
Come on
Imagine it pourin', it's rainin' down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryin' to tell us somethin'
Maybe this is God, just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward that we have empowered
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this
Without pumpin' our fists, now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice, and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it and multiply it by sixteen million
People are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a high anarchy
Strap him with a AK 47, let him go fight his own war
Let him impress Daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare to trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, its all lies the stars and stripes have been swiped Washed out and wiped and replaced with his own face
Mosh now or die, if I get sniped tonight
You'll know why, 'cuz I told you to fight
Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
Come on
And as we proceed to mosh through this desert storm
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ as we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army to disarm this weapon
Of mass destruction that we call our President
For the present and mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard, Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Verse 1:
Here I go, lyrically
I have no idea what I'm doing but I'm spiritual
on the microphone I tear up in stereo
I'm like the grand wizard, yes I'm the imperial
I have no fucking clue what the fuck I'm doing
but frithick mushy your whole life is ruined
If you try to step to me your life's in jeopardy
Cause I will seek out.....
Verse 2:
Yes, here we go break it down
I got the crown I'm about to take it now
yo I got my man and he's on the guitar
and when it comes to lyrics I go so far
like a car that I'm driving surviving on vivrin
I'm alive I'm like eye of the tiger
and I kick it so...so fucking hard
now frithick mushy go.....
Eminem: Aite
Fred Durst: Check! Slim Shady, to the mic kid.
(Eminem)
I don't do black music
I don't do white music
I make fight music
For High School kids
I put lives at risk
When I drive like this {screech}
With a slipped disk
From a Limp Bizkit diss
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs
Don't attempt this shit
Just step back
While I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I says to the girl, I'm like
"What up girl?"
"Shut up girl!"
And showed her a cut-up squirrel
She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her
Slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes
We were kissin' on a futon
{Ay yo baby!}
{What do you want?!}
I looked at 'em both and I was like
"Look, check this out toots, I'm lookin' for cookie puss"
I need to speak to him immediately
They played my video on MTV last week
And just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some
In comes Fred Durst
(Fred Durst)
Yo Shady let me get some
Who knows what galaxy I came from
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare
You stay right there
I got the fever for the flavour of a single
See me and Shady?
I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound
I got you cruisin' with your top down
These two blondes
I offered 'em both a drink
And this you would think
Could get the party started
But instead them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouths
Smelled like somebody farted
So if it's time for me to move on
Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was drunk
And a prick
Ramblin' on about how
He was gonna kill me
Wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no- He insisted we should go
Before I could drop 'em
Shady had to clock 'em
The music stopped
The party stood in shock
So I looked around
Grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
(Eminem)
Turn me loose
You better tell 'em to come re-shingle the roof
Just keep feedin' me free drinks till I puke
And Fred'll ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sittin' at the bar
I'm not bein' approached
'cause Fred's over there stealin' all of my ho's
{Yo Fred save me some}
I walked up to these siamese twins
And asked to have a threesome
Told 'em two heads are better than one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up like "Ay wait, where you goin" {bye!}
Oh well
Three strikes and I'm out
I just struck out for the third time in a row {ouch}
I ain't tryin' no more
Fuck it- I'm chillin'
Get a shot of Jager {ahhh}
Fell asleep on the ceiling
(Fred Durst)
Who knows what galaxy I came from
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare
You stay right there
I got the feeling for the flavour of a single
See me and Shady?
I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound
I got you cruisin' with your top down
These two blondes
I offered 'em both a drink
And this you would think
Could get the party started
But instead them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouths
Smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was drunk
And a prick
Ramblin' on about how
He was gonna kill me
Wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all

BUT, WHO DO WE HAVE HERE NOW!
{Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
He decides to rob a liquor store
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play}
Alright, stop!
(Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence
(But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in and gaffe the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that! Do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
(You're right)
Not over this shit
(Stop!)
Drop the biscuit
(I will)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
You know what Dre I don't like your attitude
{Meet Stan, twenty-one years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play}
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitches earlobe
Yo this girls only 15 years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
(Ah huh)
Fuck this bitch right on that spot there
Till she passes out she forgot how she got their
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie kids?
No, but I seen the porno that's on nubiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail
{Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man}
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit! You just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off
Wait! what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What'chu say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill ya motherfucker
Ah ha, temper, temper
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. A.K. comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aww fuck it what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?
[Eminem]
It's all bad now man, it's all bad
'cause y'all done FUCKED up now
YEA! Ha ha, new shit, aiyyo
I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this, but I will finish it
Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit, then you could spit
That's it, that's what it was
Back when, motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this raft
For the mic to get past, and you psyched and you gasped
Then you hype, 'cause you last
And you might whoop some ass
If you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in The Source was like
The only source of life
When the mics used to mean something, a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five
Means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas, or Benzino
Shit I don't even think you realize
You're playing with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably 'cause I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin breath to get a five
Shit I was right, I'da fuckin died already tryin
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet that's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too
*Hock spit*, fuck a relationship we through
No more Source for street cred, them days is dead
Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays' head
Every issue there's an eight page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid of this fuckin waste of lead
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old G's about to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfucking mother
You motherfucking punk
Put me on your fuckin cover just to sell your little
Sell-out mag, I ain't mad, I feel bad
Here's an ad, here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit that you don't know about, yea?
Let's talk about how you're puttin your own son out there
To try to eat off him because you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy you're bored now
I'm pushing thirty, you're kickin forty's door down
Bitch this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me
On your TV, 'cause you've got to stay up 'til
Three in the morning to see your video played once on BET
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yea
So on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
We'll never fold or hold back, just know that
Benzino's wack, no matter how many times I say his name
He'll never blow jack
You're better off tryin to bring RSO back
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion, and Ray owns a portion
So half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin and bossin Dave like a slave
They completely brainwashed him and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, 'cause I would have never said shit if you'da
Kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?
Hit it Clue, spit it Slay, new shit, exclusive
Yo Lantern, yo Whoo Kid, you know what to do with this
Use it, I'm through, this is stupid
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this
And who you callin a bitch... bitch?
You OWE me
This muthafucka man
It's ridiculous! I can't believe itHold on Em
What up?
Have a seat?Dre, I'll call you back
What now?
I don't even know where to start
Okay
I got the album from upstairs
And
And this is BY FAR, THE MOST
Incredible thing I've ever heard
Ayo, before I start this song man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
And baring with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
Yeah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one
I went away I guess to open up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
What I was going through growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins
On the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him cause the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
Thank god that I didn't do it
I would of had my ass handed to me
And I knew it but Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying
Your health is declining with your self esteem, you're crying out for help
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin' self loathing and hollow
Bottoms up of pill bottle maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
But I must be talkin' to the wall though
I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater I've put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not a egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, it's startin' to bottle
Inside 'em, one foot on the brake one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writers block in the parking lot of Mc Donalds
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded you pouted long enough
It isn't them it's you you fuckin', baby
Quit worrying about what they do and do fuckin' Shady
I'm fucking going crazy
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one
So I pick myself off the ground and fuckin' slam before I drown
Hit my bottom so hard I bounce twice suffice this time around
It's different them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come up to make it up to you no more fucking around
I've got something to prove to fans I feel like I let em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you
For those of you who don't know
The new mes back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin' up, pullin' up, blowin' up, all over no mo
My life is no longer a movie but the shows aint over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie Weezy keep ya head up
TI keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up
Don't let up, just keep slayin' 'em
Rest in Peace to DJ AM 'cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one
So here it is, dang, this feels like I just woke up or somethin'
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, ma
Ay, yo, is anybody I thought about goin' at
'Twas never nothin' personal
'Cause of some shit I was goin' thru', it's everybody else
I'm back, ay, yo
yo i keep m luv snug bruv

but what you do find is thugs luv then 2time

she gives you a raw beating for leaving
and not luvin
then shit gets heated hotter than a hot oven
cos you've broken bonds
kissed others with open tongs
being disloyal 
like whats been planted in this soil
but this is all i've herd
how they cheat and end up dead from their bird
so if you blare a word of cheating
you havent put one foot in 
you've stook both feet in
then you start watching your back from day one
like you got your clothes the wrong way on
but as i say 
i dont know no thug luv and im not one like goldie[ahah]
so were did i get this shit from?
a little birbie told me
You are now listening to the sounds of...Shady and...Alchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist...
Got an axe in the duffel bag, couple of fags,
Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged,
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh,
couple hustler mags, now grab the pez dispenser,
fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers,
The governor of Alaska, She lusts when i ask her,
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh,
while we hover over Nebraska,
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture,
in the helicopter, man i can't fuck her no faster,
she's screaming grab my titties, shady suck on those bastards,
But i ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after,
I'm a gigolo, But Ya'll look like the juggalo rapper,
Everyday man i just seem to get a little bit doper, 
Shit, Back down, 
Man I'd rather lick on a scrotum, 
And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra,
While i watch Whoopi Goldberg, Sizzle with Oprah, 
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa,
Getting home and play dick swords with the Jonas...Brothers,
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers, Like no other,
I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's...
Its chemical warfare, Drop bombs like sadam,
I'm bringing the drama, Like Barrack Obama,
Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the Octo Mama,
I'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas,
Shady, old mix
Back, second round's on me
Kuniva, Cashis, Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater
Obie Trice, what?
*** didn't kill me

Peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere with my **** restin' on a **** tongue
Sippin' on Don Perion while she's sippin' up them ****
Yeah, bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere  sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on the ****  plottin' to **** me later huh
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I **** on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman, a dude's virgin
Verses lettin' superfulious with no purpose ****
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop branch out my services
Ya try to **** this **** that's comin' from the same turf as yas
What nerves have yas
**** because your hussles ain't worth a ****
I'm gettin' rich I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a ****  you in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's **** go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda ****, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably ease when a **** is on board
I know, cry now
I know, cry now
I know, cry now
I know
I'll be damned if I let a **** lay his hands on me
I'll lay his **** out  and park a grand dam on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collides **** happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst and what can be worse
Than a verse about **** dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse **** frontin' for a ****
It's like you beggin' to die like bear huntin' with a switch
A part of my heart is gone I could never smile the same
**** finger is itchy it'll take awhile to tame
Detroit is hella dirty but the dozen can fix it
Resist and the biscuit will exceed the distance
And bounce off one's home hit and riquoche off a kid's trombone
Right to where you **** lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
Y'all shed tears but y'all can get your feel of it today
I know
I know
I know
I know
Laugh now cry never  my **** is a body part
Hit him with just enough ****  to make his body hard
Now I feel like we even see Creek is here
To shine a light on you **** diseasin'
Soon as I get my karma right on Lindsy Rose I'm leavin'
Load up a **** and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
**** they got snitches on the clock gotta watch what I'm sayin'
Me buy a **** a couple rocks  and the watch quit playin'
Back on my greasy  my neezy nobody bread whippin
And for them ****' spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime **** and grab pine you will never grab mine ****
The dolli's was lyin' when he said you was gon' be fine ****
Cashis
Witness art of war in the phyical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from cash mouth is fixin'
Ready with dope **** I'm ever dissin'
My aura of war is raw to the core
The surface of the street  when I walk through the door
My purpose is to move up pull tools you perpin'
Watch me overthrow the government in my turban
Plot up and line up solo mia
Prayin' to proof I'm searchin' for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother gone in the streets of the D
I'm talkin' to **** and hopin' **** waitin' on me
Take the first shot then, the second round's on me
And when the wars on the other side, me and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques my contracts signed just for scraps
To get you wack ****
With a gun with a **** with a bat
Take a **** through the lung, get you right what you rappin' ****
I'm born crazy raised in more fame
It's the clappin' down ****  for entertainment
I know, cry now
I know, cry now
I know, cry now
I know
Young stack he the **** on tuck want war
I don't give a **** till you kiss and pucker up
It'll lift 'em up believe me you'll flow
Duracell is your family heart broke
Lookin' like an artichoke  vegetable
Ho's stiff **** paralyzed from the neck down
My goon stick **** turn soldiers to stick figures
Hand on **** real life born ****
We roll out like four wheelers, **** sent us
From backstabbers and gold diggers tipsy off brown liquor
Watch me obnoxious broad call me cocky
Poppin' long **** stabbed it out the box like hockey
Especially when a **** ride it like jockey
From the Benz to the range to the black Joloppy
I'm the **** the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize a plan no man can stop me ball all, Stat Quo understand

Lunatic, soon as I hit the stage
My mind is like a fucking stick of dynamite
[Unverified] I get behind the mic
It's like the wick is lit, you bitches die tonight
My nine is like a guiding light at night, shining bright
My fucking grip is tighter than my wife's vagina, psych
These cock sucking cops got my Smith-N-Wesson
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon
Man, the shit's depressing
But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present
(Come on, Slim, let's go and teach this fucking bitch a lesson)
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady stay creative, baby, hold your head up, don't you let up
One bit on these motherfucking suckers you're a soldier get up
Stand up for what you believe in, long as you breathing
They jealous of you, man, that's the only reason they beefing

You done pulled the pin out my grenade
38s'll move your shit up out the way
You niggas won't forget about McVeigh, you got something to say?
Let it out today or watch these bullets spray
From these ten black fingers hugging these deadly millimeters
That'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
See I'm 'Dirty', so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater
You gets whipped with it, tell them motherfuckers Swift did it
You packing something special in your crib, then bitch, get it
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile
(Uh huh)
With this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils
You get splitted and guess what? I'm blowing up the hospital
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Finding whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em

There's no way I can be the gay rapper
(Why not?)
I only fuck animals
(Oh, haha)
Stupid trick got my dick starting to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch
One on one in this bloodsport
I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
(Your honor)
Six times I been arrested, how would you feel?
If you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested?
(It happens)
I'm smoking dank, drinking, drank
I can't have any kids 'cause I'm fucking shooting blanks
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck?
Nicole's a whore, I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut
(Uhh)
Responsibility, I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, should be stabbed
Let Richard Simmons be the President
(Ohh, hey)
Call me a weirdo, call me Bi-zarre
While I stick it up yo' ass while you shitting diarrhea

Going back to the corner where I first saw you, 
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move, 
Got some words on cardboard got your picture in my hand, 
Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am, 
Some try to hand me money they don't understand, 
I'm not...broke I'm just a broken hearted man, 
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do, 
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you... 
Cos if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me, 
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be, 
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet, 
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.
So I'm not moving... 
I'm not moving.
Policeman says son you can't stay here, 
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year,
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows, 
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.
Cos if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me, 
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be, 
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet, 
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.
So I'm not moving... 
I'm not moving.
I'm not moving... 
I'm not moving.
People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl... 
Oohoohwoo
There are no holes in his shoes
But a big hole in his world... 
Hmmmm
and maybe I'll get famous as man who can't be moved, 
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news, 
And you'll come running to the corner... 
Cos you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved... 
Cos if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me, 
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be, 
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet, 
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.
[Repeat in background]
So I'm not moving... 
I'm not moving.
I'm not moving... 
I'm not moving.
Going back to the corner where I first saw you, 
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag not I'm not gonna move.

I thought I had it all figured out I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim, but I wasn't
t tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself planted on my knees in cuffs
Which shoulda been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't just see this shit myself its me
Nobody coulda seen this shitIfelt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell to catch me
The minute she was seen she just bailed
I'm standin' and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold 2 million records I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, tryna get my feet on solid ground, so for now
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
  (Hollywood)
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"

Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"

Bury my face in comic books, 'cuz I don't wanna look
And nothing in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of tylonol I would
And hit it for good and say good bye to Hollywood
I prolly should 'cuz these problems are piled all at once
'Cuz everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father so not alotta good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cuz I don't know how to do it
All I know is that I don't want her following in the footsteps
Of my dad 'cuz I hate him so bad
Worst feeling I had was growing up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
  (Hollywood)
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
  (I feel this way)
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
I don't wanna quit this shit, it feels like this is it
For me to have this much I feel like this is it
This is not a game this fame the real life is as sick
Publicity my ass, consume my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'ma scrap it like I never wooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
That I sacrificed everything I had
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask
What about math? how come I wasn't never good at that
It's like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from bein' no one and seein' everything blow up
And all you did was grow up mceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailey the life I never had
I've forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
  (Hollywood)
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
  (I feel this way)
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"
Say "Goodbye", say "Goodbye to Hollywood"

So, goodbye

Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good
America
Ha ha ha
We love you
How many people are proud to be
Citizens of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights of men
Who have died for the protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech
The United States Government has sworn to uphold
  (Yo, I want everyone to listen to the words of this song)
Or so we're told
I never would a dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many mothafuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
Its like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched
So much anger aimed at no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays straight through your radio waves
It plays and plays till it stays stuck in your head
For days and days
Who would a thought standin' in this mirror
Bleachin' my hair wit some peroxide
Reachin' for a T shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the fore front of rap like this
How can I predict my words and have an impact like this
I musta struck a chord wit somebody up in the office
Cuz Congress keeps tellin' me
I ain't causin' nottin' but problems
And now they sayin' Im in trouble wit the government
I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumpin' it on
(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Yea
(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like ourself
If they were brown
Shady lose, shady sits on the shelf, but shady is cute
Shady knew shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby
(Ooo baby)
Look at myself,
Lets do the math if I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln high school to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
I'm too cool to go back gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No lables wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like 'Fuck it'
Until I met Dre, the only one who looked past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got was probably his in exchange
For every white fan that he's got like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
I'm like 'My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?'
(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Yea
(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
These moms probly woulda never gave two squirts of piss
Till I created so much mothafuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
Thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit me too 'cuz I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit a fine toothed comb
Its like this rope waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like
'I dont like this, no'
All I hear is lyrics, lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely 'Hip Hop' is never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch
And say faggot shit
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The mothafuckin' spokesman now
(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Yea
(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
So to the parents of America
I am the damager aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it
With a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms Cheeney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freeness of speech
This divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you
(Huh huh huh ahh)
(Huh huh huh ahh)
(Huh huh huh ahh)
(Oooh)
Ha ha ha
I'm just playin' America, you know I love you
Sh-sh-sh-shady
Aftermath, haha
G-G-G Unit, haha
'Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you're something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'
'Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cuz Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record, what
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second, bump. bump
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, thats why we came to
'Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
(50 cent, come on)
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty honey's involved
The sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never 'cuz Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return
Of the-the Doc and Shady, no one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
We came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Yeah, haha, still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha
50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leavin', let's go, haha
Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you all for comin' out, peace
Oh shit, I almost forgot
You're comin' with me
Haha, bye bye
See you in hell, fuckers
Yo, I dedicate to this to yo
To all my fans, keeping y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself
'Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditioning
Which I create, cause that's my mission
So, listen close to what we say
Because this type of fag claims to never be gay
I knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you, 'cause I get respect I pet you
(Boy)
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew
(C'mon)
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you
Pecker wood mad cause his record went wood
No, respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
And said, "Heck, country western rap records are good"
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both
(Ha, ha)
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's trying to hear some fuckin' old fart in a chair
Sittin' on stage, strummin' acoustic guitar in your ear
So, you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career
I punch you in your fuckin' chest 'til your heart kicks in gear
(Bitch)
And fuck your underground buddy's nameless crew
Like I'ma say they names so they can be famous too
You just a quitter, and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of house of pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you
(I'ma kill you)
You just a quitter, and you bitter 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you
(I'ma kill you)
Yo heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
To the rap you wrote, your fuckin' answer back's a joke
And I'ma tell these motherfucking fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
Like I ain't notice you? Bitch, I had a show to do!
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
You better shut your fuckin' mouth while you oh-for-two
Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfucking DJ and stole him too
So, you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So, now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick
Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap
Quicker but never last, and Everlast is a
Aight listen so this is what we ask of our fans
(Look)
If you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for limp
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin'
Shit in five years we'll all be eating at Whitey's
And he'll be bussin' tables in that bitch
Cleaning the toilets
Aiyyo fuck this, cut this shit off
Aiyyo Head, that's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker!
Hit 'Em Up
Kill Whitey! Hahaha
Kill Whitey! Detroit! What? What?
Kill Whitey! Yo, yo
Kill Whitey! Haha! Look
First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em coming while you running out of breath
Steady ducking while I'm punching at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MC's
Who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight, haha
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know!
Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute
Honkey, I hit 'em up!
Hahaha, yo check this out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'ma let D-12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots!
Yo! Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's getting his ass floored for talkin back
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry making fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now? There's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
With some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfucking Belle Isle Bridge
[Unverified]
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
This ain't no freestyle battle everlast getting' killed with his chest open
Tryin' to throw a fuckin' punch, but you just chokin'
Havin' a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
'Cause you suck motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin' 'bout you packing pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin' prison, pistol whipping tail, ha
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
Now it's all about country, you gave up Hip-Hop
Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
While my sales making records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit 'em up!
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got an Uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, dilated you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut
What the fuck? Is you stupid?
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin' guitar cord
And stuff him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
With sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaurant locked and block your door
'Cause we hit 'em up like motherfucking' Tupac Shakur
You a, "Black Jesus," heart attack seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country
Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off
Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise
I just believe in kicking a man while he's down goddamn, I quit
Mention my daughter's name in a song again you fuckin' punk, aiyyo
And everyone should get along
Okay children quiet down, quiet down
Children I'd like to introduce
Our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that
(Shut up)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia
(He's got AIDS)
Good luck Mr. Shady
Hi there little boys and girls
(Fuck you)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob
(Huh?)
Say hi Bob
(Hi Bob)
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job, 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks
(Ahh)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a Dr.
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you
See children, drugs are bad
(C'mon)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad
(Ask him man)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom
(That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time
(She will)
So kids say no to drugs
(That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does
(Uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin' else to say
(Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck, no you haven't seen it, it's the size of a peanut
(Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull
His back starts tah look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you
See children, drugs are bad
(That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad
(That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom
(You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time
(She will)
So kids say no to drugs
(Smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does
(That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say
(But umm)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
Problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off
Bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum, yum then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there
(Like what?)
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?)
It's yarn Claire, women stick 'em up their behinds
Go out and wear 'em
(Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?)
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung
(Gross)
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at
(Oh)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you
See children, drugs are bad
(Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad
(Put that down)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom
(You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time
(And she will)
So kids say no to drugs
(Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does
(Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say
(That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
Come on children, clap along
(Shut up)
Sing along children
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad
(South Park is gonna sue me)
So don't do drugs children
So there'll be more for me
(Mushrooms killed Kenny)
(So, fucked up, right now)
I come around like what goes around
What goes up must come down, anyone who comes up must go down
Might aswell go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breathe
Last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down bitch, get fucked with a volume knob
Fuck all you snobs, hoes now i hope all you rot
2 bottles of lupiderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought

Get rowdy as roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leaf stuck in a vacuum ya'll

Yeah but I'm home, back for the bone, back in the zone

                             I'm done
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, till I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work
For me, it just wouldn't be sufficient enough
'Cuz we are just gonna be enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be no reason speakin' wit' me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speakin' Englais
So we gonna beef and keep on beefin', unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangsta pee on himself
I see you D-12 and thanks but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all you, Ja, you'll get it too
So go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die, time's up

You's purpin', you's no threat, who's ya servin'?
We lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the deaths
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth
So go to sleep bitch

Stalk on the beat, walk wit' my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sweet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin'
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog gone bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight

And have you lookin foolish 
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
Cause you follow Future like he got carrots up his asscrack

And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
Ill crack your shoulder blade
Youll get dropped so hard

You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile
To the trailor park

My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bomb who shoots

I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl,

You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school

This guy's a gangster, his real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook

He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck Cranbrook
Fuck a beat, i go acapella
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me

And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty, 
Here, tell this people something they dont know about me.
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager
And my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn
You must not have got 'em
It probably was a problem
At the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses
Too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways fuck it
What's been up man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too
I'm out to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
Who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday
But I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam
I got a room full of your posters
And your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too
That shit was fat
Anyways I hope you get this, man
Hit me back just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote
I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad
I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me
Outside the concert you didn't have to
But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man
He's only 6 years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For 4 hours and you just said "No"
That's pretty shitty man
You're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man
He likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I write to you, you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo
With your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself
To see how much it bleeds?
It's like Adrenaline
The pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real
And I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous
'Cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like
I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like?
For people like us growing up
You've gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word
I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you
I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now
I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka
Ya dare me to drive?
You know this song by Phil Collins
'From the air in the night'
About that guy who could have saved
That other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all
Then at his show he found him
That's kinda how this is
You could have rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late
I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know
I ripped all  your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we could have been together
Think about it, you ruined it now
I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it
I hope your conscious eats at you
And you can't breathe without me
See Slim, "Shut up bitch!
I'm trying to talk"
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up
See I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more
And then she'll die too
Well gotta go
I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner
But I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now
How far along is she?
Look I'm really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on your starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show
I must have missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally
Just to diss you
And what's this shit you said about
You like to cut your wrist too?
I say that shit just clownin' dawg
C'mon, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan
I think you need some counselin''
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls
When you get down some
And what's this shit about us
Meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us
To meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself
I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you'd relax a little
I'm glad I inspire you
But Stan, why are you so mad?
Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape
But it didn't say who it was to?
Come to think about it
His name was, it was you! Damn!
For all the ladies out there
Ok
I never meant to
Give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to
Bring you to my world
And now you're lyin'
In the corner, cryin'
{Yea, woo, yea, woo
No idea
Yea, woo, yea
Thank you}
OH!
Stat quo
Here we go
Come on come on
You ready?
Let's do it man

By my side
Everywhere I go
By my side
That bein' the case
Let me tell you
Tell you bout by my side
By my side
The way I growed up
Showin' up
Chips on my shoulder

Became a hauler
Choppin' them boulders
Gettin' older
Wantin' a rover
Duckin' them rollers
Meetin' quotas
Short and bipolar
Load up and cock it

One move in the wrong direction
Ain't no flexin'

Writer of murder
The order
Leakin' out of
Your body temperature is gettin' colder
But you sweatin' like a person who ain't sober
Realizin' your life is comin' quickly to a closure
Losin' composure

Eminem: "It's the re-up" (He sounds a little like
Everlast trying to sing the blues- In other
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
[Eminem]
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I would leave it when I'm saying that
Ya'll startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black
Hope I just need a ray of that
Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say its wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep
When I wrote this,
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breeding life in me
I owe my life to you
Before the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
See this light in you, it's dark. Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gone either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gone hug me
But I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do cause...
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
[Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle
You come to me with ideas
You say they're pieces so I'm puzzled
Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like your begging for my help
Like I'm your leader
You're supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more,
I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to f-ck with the white boy tramp, crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my time to save yours
But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dying I need you, come back for fuck's sake
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
[Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said they was riding to the death of it
But where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them 
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gone see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the f-ck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack 
Maggots and the cracker's ass
Little crackerjack beat making wack math,
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving again
I'll guarantee they'll scream "Dre don't leave us like that man!" cause...
[Chorus]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Artist: dj jazzy jeff f/ eminem and parl yams
(scratched) (3x):
"no...you hear me! you go to hell" -> mr. garrison
[eminem]
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Moms wouldn't take it, the bitch still hates me
One day she said, "go rake leaves," I said, "make me!"
I'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, "please fix me!"
Back then, when will smith was still the fresh prince
And him and jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta the fake school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
Break shit!
(scratched) (4x):
"no...you hear me! you go to hell!"
[parl yams]
Yo, y'all rappers have never learned
That's why I'm fuckin wit y'all
Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit parl
I bring it to your high school, smoke the prom
Put your brother in an air lock, choke your mom
Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven
Walk around ripping on niggas madder than james evans
My left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra
Slap my dick like kool keith
Fuck like you stole from me, and rules the streets
I don't wanna have to fuck you up, so cool cease
Parl yams be the chosen thug
What I spit be cold juice like a fruitful hug
Run the streets while you're stuck at home
My temper life bushwick bill fucker leave me the fuck alone
I've been jealous since niggas was windmillin'
These cats just started to rhyme, my pen's spillin'
And moms just told me to act, I've been wheelin'
So boy just slow your deck, I've been stealin'
I wet rappers cause it's me and em
I guess I just ain't give a fuck like eminem
Burglarize take busts with the slugs
Come in your window like (? ? ? ) and bustin' your club
Put the heat up I teach them niggaz what to suck
And my young lords, when to stand up and light the dutch
(scratched) (4x):
"no...you hear me! you go to hell!"
[eminem]
I ended my last show with a horse swingin' a lasso
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that
Two zantacs I give a fuck if I sound whack
Billboard, drugs is what I kill for
I'm happy gilmore, you slip me anything in pill form
I'm in to mingle but I plan to stay single
Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle
Sike, I'm 24 thursday; six more birthdays
And I'm blowin my brains out when I'm thirty
As long as my heart beats i'ma keep tryin to see
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep
So "i'm the rapper, he's the dj"
I'm the one thats got the six year old nephew screamin "f/u/c/k"
So jeff, give me a scratch (scratched: "no!")
Y'all can kiss my ass until your lips stick to my pants
(scratched) (5x):
"no...you hear me! you go to hell!"
By bookmat
I don't think you understand
That what you're doing is not so cool
You think it's funny to mess with my mind
Don't you
You know I like you so you just tease me
You give me just enough to hang on enough
When you're just wasting my time
You're simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time
Do you hear me when I say
So let me ask you something
Do you think I'm pretty or don't you
Do you wanna get with me or not and nowwww
Or are you just wasting my time
You're simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time
And what would you've got to say
Well things have got to change
Say this just isn't right
I don't wanna have to fight
And I think I'd better go
Cause this ain't working out any more
And I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
Understand
That what you did
Was just not so cool
Baby, you're just not that cool
Intro: Frogg
Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...
Verse One: Eminem
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman
Chorus:
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Verse Two: Eminem
I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
Chorus
Verse Three: Eminem
Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
Chorus
Outro: Eminem
Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..
Whooooooo Shady.............
 I used to be a man but now im a boy i used to treat my paddleing pool like it was a toy. But know im a bit more older i see what it is, its like a fucking pair on conjoint simese twins twinnnns. One Day my mother said to me "why dont you ever play outside" i used to crawl under my pool and hide i used to weath and duck to avoid her but then my friend carrington came and destroyed her, i used to this he was a dude but then he became orfully so rude. He used to say "Oi Marshell go back to bed your not wanted no more" so i packed up my pool and snuck out of my living room it was dark and fuzzy and i counldnt see a boom i looked into the window and saw christiphor reades he was taunting me and laughing at mee so i took out my pool and hit him over the head i told him to go to my house and go under my bed.
(I don't know why this)
Yes man, as the world turns
  (World keeps turning round and round)
We all experience things in life
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Trials and tribulations
  (I don't know why this)
That we all must go through
  (World keeps turning round and round)
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
And light up like Jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
'Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source, yo
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool, takin' the shit, now warn bulls
They threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin
Oh my god it's you! Not again
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cuz I murdered my guinea pig
And stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers, and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin'
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is Phys Ed
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed slim fast
(Who me?)
Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tanny's
And stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
  (I don't know why this)
As the world turns
  (World keeps turning round and round)
These are the days of our lives
These are the things
That we must go through
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Day by day
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape
From their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
'Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pale of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryin'  to nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said "What up, its nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat ya to a Bagel and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cuz you know your stinkin' ass is too fat to try to outrun me"
I went to grab my gun, thats when her ass put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin' crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her but so I gotta catch her first
Ran threw alleys, parkin' lots, and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room thats when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now
She said "Come in, its unlocked!"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said "Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted "Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
{Come here bitch
Come here
Take this motherfuckin' dick
Bitch, come here}
  (I don't know why this)
And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
  (World keeps turning round and round)
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
  (I don't know why this)
And challenges everyday
That we must go through
  (World keeps turning round and round)
These are the things that surround us
Through our atmosphere
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Every day
  (I don't know why this)
Every single day the world keeps turning
Keeps turning
Keeps turning
  (World keeps turning round and round)
  (But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
"Morning, Marshall."
"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, we know you're a busy person."
"But I thought variety was the most important thing?"
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"Steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Man, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
"No, no, no, no, NO!"
*Alarm sounds* "oh, shit"
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous wake-up show
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin' holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk, snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up
When I woke up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali locked up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin'
Look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leavin' MC's lipless
On the Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9NE's filled"
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
'Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows
(Where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
"Hey that's my couch, bitch", pull a nine out during a rhyme 'bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin' a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin' upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject
Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off, sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
Oh, huh, C now like Omar Credle, we pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution
I sway the tech wit the Tech & Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin' your neck away
Flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of Jake investigate
What? Sway can give it to you but whatcha gon' do wit it?
Tech can give it to you but whatcha gon' do?
Rev can give it to you but whatcha gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what?
Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin' murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin' wit Sway & Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in
De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin' wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets, I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin' to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway & Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle
Fresh, for ninty-nine you suckas
When I was just a little baby boy
My Mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my Daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These motherfuckers are thinkin', I'm playin'
Thinkin I'm sayin' this shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You god damn right bitch and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"
Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't 'Acid Rap' but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal' ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"
Know why I say these things?
'Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Till I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said, "Shut up", when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
Bitch I'ma kill you!
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"
I said, "You don't, wanna fuck with Shady
(Why not?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you"
I'm just playin' ladies
You know I love you
[Eye-Kyu:] Check it out, 
[Eminem:] Hey Kyu!
[Eye-Kyu:]
[Chorus:]
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
[Verse 1: Eminem]
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till I'm glad to be buried 
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q
[Eye-Kyu:]
[Chorus:]
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep 
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity 
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool 
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth
[Eye-Kyu:]
[Chorus:]
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, I can't sleep
Whatever
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo
I sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet in the air
I don't care who is there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Coz I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'coz they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Havin this happenin'
Then attack Eminem 'coz I rap this way
But I'm glad 'coz they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Coz I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is"
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'coz I talk
With an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin'
The same fuckin' questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Coz they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit, in the bathroom
Without someone standin' by it
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
'Coz I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Coz I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am
Wahoo, guess who's back?
Mommy, we're home
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody, put your hands where my eyes can see
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D-Bo was 50
Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
'Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from [unverified] be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes and clears out
And that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all 'cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's 'bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is 'bout to go off
Shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin' sprayed
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911
Step off my holster 'cause shit it's getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches till there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon
About to change, 'cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin' sprayed
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911
Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip hop, this function is where did it
When I put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamor
When you enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to save hip hop the task is something greater
'Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s
About to change, 'cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin' sprayed
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
'Cause hip hop is in a state of 911
Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shakin' that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit face-ted
Pasted, blasted, puke, drink, throw up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated them hips
And licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit
Two to the one, from the one, to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one, to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'ma continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights blind
We about to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck I say
Every day she be givin' it up
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rininse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish, shh
Yeah, me and Nate D-O double G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party
We about to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
I heard she was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
We bout' to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck I say
Every day she be givin' it up
There she goes, shakin' that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
God, I'm old
I ain't leavin' without you bitch
Come here, home with me
And my boy, and his boy, and his boy, and his girl, haha
Nate Dogg
I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous an' shit
'Cuz I'm like the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show because
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cuz once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
So I get off stage right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby"
They're all like, "Oh, my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God dude, you fucking rock
Please Marshall please, let me suck your cock"
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I  drop the beat and do my ocupellas
All the chicks start yellin', "All the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage"
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryin' to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cuz I told him Jessica Albas my wife to be
This rockstar shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me
Because these
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cuz once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
MY band, baby
You just want to see a nigga backwards, don'tcha?
Hey man, how come we don't rap on Protools?
And smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in a van, and he in a tour bus
You want my autograph you's a liar
No, I'm Swift
(Oh, I thought you was Kuniva)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
'Cuz our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, it's simple but
All I did was read a Russel Simins book
So I'm more intact tryin' to get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while gettin' whipped on my back
Look at 'em little punk ass, thinkin' he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself takin' all the pics
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for sound check
Man, I ain't goin' to sound check
But our mics are screwed up
And his always sound best
You know what man? I'ma say som'm
Aiyo 'em
You got som'm to say?
Man, nothin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man whasup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like and man shut up
You ain't even back me up and were supposed to be crew
Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
(I swear man)
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cuz once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
They say the lead singers hot but the group is not
Once they've sold our arenas to amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut him mike off when the music starts
Aiyo, it's
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, 'Hey dude, I love your band"
We ain't a band bitch
We don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
Of these guys actin' funny over area codes
Proof carry my bag
Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage security in the way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?
Goddamnit I'm sick of this group
It's time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack
Lose yourself video
(I was in the back)
Superman video
(I was in the back)
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like who is D12, how we get started?
But what about Eminem? Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute
Fitty told me do sit ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12 I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with the real Roxanne
Girl, why can't you see you're the
Only one for me and it just
Tears my ass apart to know that
You don't know my name
(Punch)
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
(Haha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
(Fuck Marshall)
'Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
(Yeah)
All because I'm the lead singer of my
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
MY band, baby
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance "My salsa"
Look out for my next single it's called, "My salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa"
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa
Where'd everybody go?
50 Cent: Sh-sh-sh-shady
Aftermath, haha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha
Chorus: Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Eminem: Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down
Dr. Dre: Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad
Eminem: You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'
Chorus: Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Eminem: When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Dr. Dre: The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
Eminem: We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
Dr. Dre: But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cuz Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
Eminem: Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, thats why we came to
Chorus: Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Eminem: 50 cent, come on!
50 Cent: Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
Dr. Dre: And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Eminem: Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
Dr. Dre: You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
Eminem: So never say never cuz Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
Chorus: Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time
Eminem: Yeah, haha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha
50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leavin', let's go haha
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace!
Oh shit, I almost forgot
You're comin' with me [gun shot]
Haha, bye bye![gun shot]
Slim Shady
Slim Shady
Slim Shady
Slim Shady
Well, I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes like a soap opera episode
And punch a bitch in the nose, till her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate, girls, women and bitches
Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets
Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin' through the airport, sluggish, walkin' on crutches
Hit a fuckin' pregnant chick in her stomach with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out and back out
Lookin' for some other thug, to beat the crap out
I'm bringin' you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate in English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speakin' so much Spanish, pun can't even understand it
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy, Slim Shady
Yeah
Won't you busa rhyme for me boy, Slim motherfuckin' Shady
Yeah
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy, Slim Shady
Yeah
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy
I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically
(One more time)
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of Earl, head twirls every time the toilet swirls flush
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up
(Shut up)
I made this rap game suspenseful, 'cause now I got a impulse
To give you insults wrote with a pencil
(Bitch)
And waste the paper on you, choppin' down the oakwood
'Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nuttin'
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy, Slim Shady
Yeah
Won't you busa rhyme for me boy, Slim motherfuckin' Shady
Yeah
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy, Slim Shady
Yeah
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy
Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady on some shit daily
What you want what you got is it hot?
(Is it hot?)
Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
What you want, what you want, ahh, uhh, yo
A person from another planet might disagree with you
Well, if you want my opinion, it comes from right here on Earth
Slim Shady, Misdemeanor
Timbaland, Slim Shady, Misdemeanor
I'm homicidal, and suicidal with no friends
Holdin' a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' tecs at you until you see your fuckin' legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
Fuckin' mad dog, foamin' at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin' at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground
(Keep filming)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped 'em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin' again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy, get back
Uhh, I'ma put you all in the line
Uhh, and I'ma watch you MC's die
Yo mommy, mommy, Missy done lost her mind
I think somebody done pissed her off this time
Yo, I'ma have to bust you through your chest and
Uhh, you will have to clean up the mess
It's rainin', rainin' and it's pourin' loud
Never fear, 'cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
Uhh, I hear the gats go cha-pow
Who shot me dammit? Bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile
Lay 'em on down, like they lived underground
For the sound, that me and, Timbaland, we found
Get your ass, kicked later or get your ass kicked now
Uhh, one-two
Misdemeanor, Slim Shady
Timbaland, motherfucker
Uhh uhh uhh, cool, cool, cool
Triple zero
Hey hey hey (x3)

Let's go!
Yo, I can't sing but I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cuz I'm happy, yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back, yo, check it out
Somedays I sit staring out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
My baby girl keeps getting' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes 'cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit, don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That Imma pistol packin' drug addict, who bags on his mama
But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled, that hurts deep inside
Of my soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should have seen it coming, what I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'?
But fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
'Cuz my baby knows that her dad's a soldier
Nothing can take her from me
Told you I can't sing
Oh, well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said
If you ever need anything
Daddy would be right there?
Guess what? Daddy's here
And I ain't going nowhere
Baby, I love you

Somebody, please help him!
*giggle*

Verse #1:
There's no mountain i can't climb
There's no tower too high,
No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, destroy you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
*Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound*
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
Sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off
Dr Dre:
Suck it marshall
Eminem:
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one of these russians, and that's all

Blow every fucking thing, except afghanistan on the map, off
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off
*Knocking*

Hailie:

Verse 2:
It's like my mother always told me
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom*
Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine n goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you aint got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Er..
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks for second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Then quit bringin my flos, quit giving me my ammo
Can't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my ammo
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
Am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more?
Hailey:
Dad
Chorus
Verse #3:
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
So what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,
Cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd gank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
Like r kelly as soon as "bump n' grind" comes on
More pain inside o' my brain, in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the world trade, standin' on ronny's grave,
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather as clyde mathers and bonnie jade
And nash briddy musta just stop it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heater's desk, and two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither
Chorus
Outro:
Eminem:
Crazy
Hailie:
*laughs*
You're funny daddy!
Well Jimmy moved in with his mother
'Cuz he ain't got no place to go
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes
'Cuz
You live at home in a trailor
What the hell you gonna do?
Yee Haw
'Cuz
I live at home in a trailor
Mom I'm coming home for you
Break it down
Well my name is Jimmy
His name is Greg Beau
Me him and you we went to the same school
This ain't cool
I'm in a race
He's tappin' my mom
We're almost the same age
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car
Thanks a lot mom
Here Happy Birthday Rabbit
Here's a brand new car 
You can have it
A 1928 Delta
This shit wont even get me to the shelter
'Cuz
You live at home in a trailor
What the hell you gonna do?
'Cuz
I live at home in a trailor
Mom I'm coming home for you

Long time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12...
D12 back in the news again today...
Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem; he insists he's just taking a break, but now its believed hes retiring, leaving us all to ask: Will the Real Slim Shady please stand up?
[Verse 1]
So this is it...
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed 
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me (in)to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorce, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk
[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I said
Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least
A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit
[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I said
Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
Chorus: 
[Skam] 
Yo, I'm tryin' to be the man of the day 
Three six five a year 
See the bullshit you sayin', Skam ain't tryin' to hear (Fuck that!) 
Bustin' lyrics in the air 
Keepin' some up in the chamber 
[Eminem] 
Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin'? 
[Skam] 
Man, I'm releasin anger! 
[Eminem] 
I'm tryin' to be the illest of the day 
Three six five a year 
See that bullshit you sayin', Shady ain't tryin' to hear 
Spittin' lyrics in your ear 
Keepin' some up in the chamber 
[Skam] 
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doin'? 
[Shady] 
I'm releasin anger! 
[Skam] 
Man I'm tired of bein' tired, everytime I wake up 
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein' late for the bus 
Tired of all be blendin', and endin' up datin sluts 
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up! 
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up 
Gold diggin' bitches, the buck stops here 
The road to riches is closed for repair 
So if the shoe ain't fittin, girl leave that shit alone 
You aint Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone? 
I rip your tissue out your ear 
Spittin' like I don't care 
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year 
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up 
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump 
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit 
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit 
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down 
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now 
At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk 
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked 
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck 
Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck 
Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind 
I be stackin' up white rappers like im throwin' gas signs 
And I'm, buck wild exposin the plain truth 
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room 
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar 
For this bad car, that go along with the breath 
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft 
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber 
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doin?) 
Chorus 
[Eminem] 
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change 
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name 
Became late to the last show with a different dane 
Brain ate from the last "O" that I snifed off caine 
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas 
When your puke is turnin' to yellowish-orange mucus 
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers 
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English 
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish 
Burn you alive till you screamin' to be extinguished 
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence 
Start a fire and block the hydrants 
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than 
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin' 
You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin 
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version 
Stoppin your short life while you're still a teen virgin 
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon 
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery 
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum iternally 
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name 
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame 
I'll take it further back than that 
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and 
Cock-block your father's game 
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled 
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle 
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout 
I'ma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out 
Chorus
[Intro]
It Fits Perfect
[Verse 1]
Better watch out sucka now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught comin and I'm packin in my lunch a
Buncha missle launchers 'n a buncha contra
Ban-van full of ganja, now come on ja-
Man stop! Man said, "Marshall, Oh-my-God, ya
Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quad-ra-
Polegic, boogyin down to Frank Sinatra."
Lindsey to the Lohan, naked will you let me watch ya?
Who'd a knew the pew'd a do to me what it's done?
Such sin-a-sism when it isn't in my system.
Blunt-igmatism betta spliff up to my lips son,
So much on my hands, I gotta give my kids a fist-bump.
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks,
"Mista, help me"'s what he said to me, and then sunk.
Women, skinnin them and cuttin them up in chunks,
In clumps - the woman with cocoa-butter skin once.
[Chorus]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin em up, hem em, sew em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
[Verse 2]
Always, you can see him lurkin in the hallways-
Carcasses of caucasian females in his crawlspace.
How the hell did he fit em all into such a small place?
Hide em in the wall- well how long will the drywall take?
Well fuck it then, I've got nothin but time- I'll wait.
Until it dries, for the moment I guess you're all safe.
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's outta gas, my regular saw ain't.
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin,
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within. 
Someone's in the back of my damn house rummagin,
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin.
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryin to fight? You will never win.
Severin legs, arms, damn there goes another limb.
Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident.
[Chorus]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin em up, hem em, sew em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
[Verse 3]
Now, what ya know about Buffalo Bill?
Nothin, so chill. Fuckin hoe, ya better fuckin hold still.
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill.
Cut em, gut em 'n just get to stuffin those girls.
Man,I think she had enough of those pills,
So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel
Blades, Baby when I cut ya don't squeal,
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin told you!
I keep hearin voices, like "Wouldn't ya like to go an get your butcher knife,
And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers
into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her
What ya usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?"
"In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are."
I'll be sure to Gin-sue ya til there's no more skin to ya.
Boo-ya, who ya think your fuckin with? Duck, because here he comes again.
[Chorus]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin em up, hem em, sew em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill, 
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
The little green flower with the yellow on top
You told me the name but I soon forgot
I know roses and forget-me-nots what's
That little green flower with the yellow on top
We got married in a little white church
I had a big red rose on my shirt
You had some flowers but you gave them away
And the little green flower was bloomin' that day
It's that little green flower with the yellow on top
You told me the name but I soon forgot
I know roses and forget-me-nots what's
That little green flower with the yellow on top
Remember the night that I came home drunk
Stopped in the driveway got you a bunch
You got mad said they shouldn't be picked
They were there next morning when I woke up sick
It's that little green flower with the yellow on top
You told me the name but I soon forgot
I know roses and forget-me-nots what's
That little green flower with the yellow on top
It's been a long time since I gave you that ring
You often said I didn't know a bloomin' thing
But happy anniversary and look what I got
Some little green flowers with the yellow on top
It's shit like this I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Oops, I did it again, didn't I? My shit's harder
To figure out than what Britney's tit size is
Ooh, I probably pissed you off again, didn't I bitch?
So what? Christina Gaguilera kiss my grits
You know how many shit's I get if I wish I did
So, I can quit givin' these twisted little kids ideas
This just in, Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit fucked and dick sucked him
If Afflec can get his ass licked, how I can't shit
Goddamn bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this
Are those pictures they made of us together on the Internet?
As close as I'm ever gonna get to hittin' it from the back
And shit when it comes to that I hit harder from the back
Than Everlast when he's pluggin' Lethal in his fuckin' ass
Just give me one more chance, Britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
Fuck your jewelery, my record's almost diamond, beotch
What's goin' on in the world today?
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music
What's goin' on in the world today?
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music
Eminem doesn't like N'Sync, well I do
So fuck him and the Backstreet Boys too
Whatever happened to the cast of Different Strokes
Mary's broke, Ty's snortin' coke and then an overdose
I got two little boys with me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me
I'm up early wit my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furly, fuckin' Laverne and Shirley
A lotta rappers are livin' in la la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha Men
As bad as a life I had, I'm not mad
I don't need to be a jackass to beat up my dad
My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned
And she keeps askin' me why I rap wit a honky
But Granny, I'm a flunky, I could be a junky
I could be hangin' with the hoochies out at the club scene
To all the independent women in the house, hey
Show us your tits and shut your motherfuckin' mouth, what?
Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie, Whitney Houston
The shit's confusin', Jesse Jackson, reverend scandal
Got George Michael's, Tevin Campbell's', PeeWee Herman's
Peep show places, public restrooms, peep those cases
What's goin' on in the world today?
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music
What's goin' on in the world today?
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music
Huh, your mom and dad probably mad at us, for what?
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
Ain't like where I'm from, we don't bite our tongue
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns?
It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme
Where you work you ain't gettin' paid for that overtime
It's only music, media know it but they blind
I ain't in your light, so stay they hell up outta mine
Y'all the reason why Princess Diana ended up dyin'
If you people get offended I don't care, stop cryin'
Tryin to get us to leave 'cuz what we say just ain't clean, uh, uh
But holdin' back on what I say just ain't me
Now, what's these parents all mad for?
Your music is bad for, um, for teenage kids that drink
More than Ted Danson in Cheers Carson drink beers
We all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch, shut up
Broke or rich, I still do that same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit
So when they ask me about my sarcasticness
I just slap 'em, turn around and ask 'em this
What's goin' on in the world today?
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music
What's goin' on in the world today?
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre, it ain't nuttin' but music
Hoo hoo hoo
(Intro)
I dunno man, just feels like, well alot different
Kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now
Feels strange but um, I guess it's kinda like... it's kinda like
(Verse 1)
I feel like I'm morphin, into something so indcredible, that I'm dwarfin'
All competetors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphin side-effect
Your self esteem shatters his dialect
Comes blasting out your deck, she loves me
So much passion you'd expect this sort reaction from her yet
Your strong oh, you're fucking corny, you try to turn your charm on
Cause you just think you're Bishop the don one
But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like 'Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like "she's fucking with dude, she wants son"
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do? How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closing her eyes, fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track
(Hook)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Verse 2)
She's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc, CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not, awww
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sick back and just keep rhyming one syllable, nah
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up, cause they're just not good enough
But I'm not giving up til I get my respect, and I won't stop til I get enough
Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations, aww
That hater alarm is sounding off, and Obama took the bomb from my name, aww
So quit crying that I took your dame, homie she's my dame, aww
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came for it
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man I can't call it
(Hook)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Verse 3)
It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker
Dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducing her, loosen up with a little freestyle
Wait, am I losing ya? Am I making you look bad?
Well I got news for ya homie, you're losing her
Oh wait she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryna show how, let me slow it down
It's still gonna be a blowout
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something
To see if you can save any of it punk, but none of it's fucking with me
Prick you really feeling that bullshit?
You think you killing them syllables? quit playing
These beats ain't nothing to fool with
They call me fire Marshall, I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From sucking my dick, aww fuck
(Hook)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Is this thing on? Where'd everybody go?
Guess who's back? Back again
Ken is back, tell some men
Rub my back, rub my back, rub my back, rub my back
Eh, wait hello? Eh, goodnight
Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfucking anthem (hip hop)
To hip hop music (anthem)
Cause I'm gonna keep doing hip hop music
until the day that I die (aight bitch)
Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ouija boards
Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's
Jumping off roof tops drunk after i do shots
Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rots
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizza's, now i got twelve visa's
So tell jesus I'm gonna quit sinning when hell freezes
[chorus]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's prolly why my nights are getting colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I'll be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over
Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap
I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap
I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and i stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced ain't it, taste tainted
The whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like sci-fi t.v.
Fuck ICP buy my cd
cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut
telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Aint no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth
[chorus]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's prolly why my nights are getting colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over
Uh, uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ah
Uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ah
Uh uh uh uh(Dr. Dre)
Ah ah ah ah(Slim shady) (Outsiders)
[Eminem talking]
Yeah yeah
Tricky
Let's show 'em some love
Welcome to Detroit
[Chorus - Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome you to Detroit City
I said Welcome to Detroit City
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good man they all say Tricky
[Verse 1 - Eminem]
Click click boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear 'em holla Goon Squad in this bitch
Let me hear you holla Goon Squad in this bitch
Let me hear you holla Runyon Ave. in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky
I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk, fuck that, bla bla
I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit, Trick Trick
Quick come pick me up, bring them guns
Come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil' fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie come get me, Chedda boys what up though I see you
Rock Bottom, yeah I see you, all my Detroit people
Where you at man, let me see them hands in the sky
Detroit motherfuckers 'till we die
[Chorus - Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome you to Detroit City
I said Welcome to Detroit City
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good man they all say Tricky
[Verse 2 - Trick Trick]
Homie it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
Marshall call me the fifty four and laced the track
This the beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Squad
And gangsta been bangin' the underground since '95, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house
[Chorus - Eminem]
[Verse 3 - Trick Trick]
Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can fear me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us
[Chorus - Eminem]
[Outro]
Yeah, Trick Trick
Eminem, Wonder Boy, Shady
It's goin' down baby
Ayo Em, I got you back my nigga
Damn right I said my nigga
That's my nigga
Tricky
Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms.Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me? Well I'm back
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
Hum-die-die-la-la-la

Verse 1
I 'ma clean this whole shit out like climax,
With words put togeather better then sony electronics,
King of the jungle, humbly stay honest,
Eat with the lions, swim with peranas,
Gassoline the scene, strike the match,
Inferno, I'm to throue nigga, so stand back,
I spit shine, get mine and rip rhyme
And make my career take a incline,
I'm strick with knives, straight with razors,
Good with grenades and great with gadges, (yeah)
Been around the world on a million stages,
Watch nigga's bitch up and go through changes,
I had gun's before guns was in fashion,
I mashed out before niggas knew mashin,
I knew terror before the plane started crashin,
I got punch lines and nigga's ain't laughin...
Chorus
I'm gon be here after the smoke dye down,
Insomnia style I won't lye down,
Fight the good fight don't need no help,
Keep your hands up defend yourself,
Move like I move and live lifelong ,
Can't move up if your hearts not strong,
Get your own shit cause this shit's mine,
Every time I spit, I shine
Verse 2
Cock-sucker I preach what I practise,
Back shit up, wrap this, rap shit up,
Still actin up, get found in the trunk of an acuva,
Yall suck like jail in dracula,
X turn up the heat, increase the hatred,
Straight stone face don't fuck with gay shit,
So I guess that means I cant fuck with you now,
Drew down, let off, facate to new town,
You feel like bishop, induced now,
Gotta flame thrower that will burn
Great holes till you goose down, (yeah)
Rough sound, same strong background,
Bent on black the big boys playin tips down,
My whole train of thought is the party,
Any motherfucker with problems and not get caught,
I was blessed with life when I cursed to death,
I'm a spit till my very last breath...
(fuck y'all)
Chorus
Verse 3
Let me get a three second look, I hit a million dollar target,
You ain't came up yet well nigga' let me show ya, (aaaa)
Come across dope like planes and boats,
Like baloons filled with coke, down a mexican's throat,
You ever seen a man get smoked and shit on himself,
The body shake for a second, then it can't stop a second,
The evidence are the weapon and the people involved,
Let one nigga talk, everybody gettin caught, for sure,
I say that, to say this,
If you cant handle the time then ride the beach,
Might as well touch your tail and jump the fence,
Castrate yourself expose the bitch,
X go head up, the fuck never ran from it,
I got engadged with buck shots that you can't stomach,
You ain't a killer you a album filler,
You ain't a soldier you a rap premoter,
Game over...
Chorus
Uh, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We're renegades, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We're renegades, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hit me up man
**** I'm from the ***** yo' hood ain't no realer
You the **** livin' next to the killer
I'm the killer that moved out of the block
And head back to the hood, when I'm movin' my ****
You can find me on a dark road, dark clothes
****, in the console and God knows I make grip off ****
****, I could get rich off blows
My nation affiliation pitch forks I've chose
What the **** you gon' do? We bang back ****
I'm a six point star in a gray bandanna
I'd die for this, **** you rhyme for this
**** I ride for this and did time for this
That's why I'm convinced you fear, that I'm convicted
Until elevens in soaps, and some gangsta **** man
Guess who gorillas leave tats in fragments
Two **** through your cabbage, and gas from Ca$h
**** always talkin' that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
**** talkin' all that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a *****
Tip our levels and scarce piece, a meal beast
We'll creep one deep, slump seat, dump ****
**** scream "**** me, he lucky, when I **** it
I left respect enough for an open casket
Way to go Ca$his, boost up my ego
Let loose, out sunroof with my Eagle
Folk of the century, rollin' with peoples
The omen, the sequel, the more they will see you
Close kin, **** close to no skin
His momma pretends that she doesn't know him
I'm the reason for the whole 'Say No' slogan
**** in folk and locoed if provoking
Got a brand new **** with the **** in
Leave your family with the wake for hostin'
I'll collect enough **** 'til my hands the Aspens
I'm the realest **** 'round here, ask for Ca$his folk
**** always talkin' that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
**** talkin' all that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
Loadin' the cup folk, loadin' it up tote
Hang fire up I, choke from the **** smoke
That's on the boss man, my **** Ross came
Place **** into a coffin
This is renegades, Rick not really paid
Gave Ca$h pistols, now they milli ****
Full **** of **** that's really weight
While my workers foldin', now that's really cake
Give it right back to 'em, watch it regenerate
I'm a degenerate black bandit, livin' ape
**** dig in they pockets like DJ's dig in crates
If you cuttin' my profits, you gon' in to dish some cake
**** and ****
I'm the independent kingpin, **** Koch
****, plus sold O-Z
**** never son me, I was born O.G. fo'
**** always talkin' that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
**** talkin' all that ****
What you flaggin', who you **** with? I don't give a ****
You can live in the hood and ****
But remember who you **** with, I don't give a ****
Aiyyo Alchemist
Let's play 'em some of that new Stat Quo **** man
[50 Cent] 
Yeah, Shady, 50 Cent
G G G G G G G G-Unit 
[Eminem] 
Here we go again yeah 
[50 Cent] 
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow? 
You can't understand how I get my dough 
50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so 
I'm on fire 
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne 
I just get on the track and try to set the tone 
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone 
But don't compare me 
I'm better off jus' left alone 
And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales 
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself 
Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12 
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail 
And livin wreckless 
But if you will check my belt 
You may see something else I used to protect myself 
A vest, to stop a Ruger and deflect the shells 
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrels 
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to 
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you 
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line 
But this motherfucker Ja musta lost his mind 
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX 
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next 
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael 
Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled 
We'd all much rather get along invite you 
Me and Hailie dance to your songs we like you 
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth 
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you 
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to 
But I will if I have ta, with syllable after syllable I just slap ya 
Killin' you fasta than you poppin' pill afta little pill of them tabs of that shit you on 
But if you want it you got it you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it 
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta 
We bump heads wit any motherfucker that wants ta 
So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk? 
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg? 
How come you didn't say you had a problem then? 
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then 
I'ma grown man dawg come holla 
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow, 
another one of them little X pills in front of me 
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be, come on 
[50 Cent] 
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon gon' see 
You don't wanna bump heads with me 
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see 
You don't want to bump heads with me 
[Tony Yayo] 
You couldn't son me if my father helped you 
My punchlines is hot, my bars'll melt you 
Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you 
Every other week I'm buyin a new pistol 
I clap at your ass with this chrome 38 
And put six thru your hats of seven 3/8 
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you Shook Knight 
I put my knife in ya wind pipe and freeze ya on the turnpike 
You know and I know who took ya chain 
You got robbed two times so ya ass a lame 
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail 
You betta stick to tha movies with Steven Seagal, bitch 
[50 Cent] 
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon will see 
You don't wanna bump heads with me 
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see 
You don't want to bump heads with me
[Lloyd Banks] 
Fuck that I'm tired of hearing  
these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand 
Like I don't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man 
We killing New York, even in Compton they understand 
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate up out tha vam an'... 
They see me pop off boy more icey 'cause I could 
But you done gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood (hood)
Plus when you paranoid it's hard to make a song 
How you want it wit' us, when half your artists got make-up on?
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer pictures 
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches 
You don't know nuttin' about what pain is sucka 
I'll put your ass to the ground like a train conductor, muh'fucker 
[50 Cent] 
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me 
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon will see 
You don't wanna bump heads with me 
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me 
You, talk an' you soon you will see 
You don't want to bump heads with me

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You wanna spray at me? Go head
The last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Ya little sister callin you stupid
Reason why?
Her and ya momma in the livin room now hog-tied
I came up wit two new ways to get rich I cant wait
Got a brand new cig
And that old thirty eight
I be scheming to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watchin Dre serve skunk
Through the hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine
Sell em' back the next day
You thought I really wanted ya pussy
Bitch please
This is stash house, jack pot,
Leave her them keys
My black g-unit hoody just reak of marijuana
Cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
Im serious man

This the flow right here
That fucked up Jeffery's career
Make money, take money
Yeah nigga yeah
[Chorus]
Nigga that watch is nice
That's what you bought from me
That chain is nice
That's what you bought from me
Them earrings is nice
That's what you bought from me?
Take that shit off,
Move I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, ski mask way

[Verse 2]
Whos dat peepin in my window
Wow

They know when im sleepin
They know when im wake
I know they got my phone taped
Im screamin fuck jake
Im tryin to stay out them pens,
So I switched states
Bad news V-A now that sounds great
I see niggas wit that ice on, rims shined up
This towns one big pussy waitin to get fucked
I holla at A-I peoples to get gats
They charged me 500 a piece for two macs
Then im back doin me
Im back out on a spree
Catch me n' niggas slippin out pumpin dat D
Give me a lil' crew I'll have em' pumpin for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name in N-Y they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doin dirt but a nigga low key
[Chorus]
Nigga that watch is nice
That's what you bought from me
That chain is nice

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will, The Real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorce, throwin' her over furniture
It's the return of the, "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!
Feminist women love Eminem
Chigga chigga chigga, "Slim shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss"
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the discovery channel don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals", well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes
I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
You little bitch, put me on blast on M.T.V
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me
'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with jergens
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a slim shady lurkin'
He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real shady please stand up?

And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control

Still on?
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check
Alright, let's do it
Let's go, come on
(Eminem, Eminem, Eminem)
Evil Deeds
-----------------------------
Lord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done
[Chorus]
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off
(head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn
(elses lawn, elses lawn, elses lawn)
Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt, uncle Edna 'n Charles
(Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just dont understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?
[Chorus]
Predominantly, predominantly, everythings always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black
But what about me, where does that leave me
Well I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
What do I look like some kind of idi-wait a minute, shit, don't answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit, 
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
[Chorus]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these deamons
I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
This Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what it feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe see doe now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please god, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, myself is gone
[Chorus x2]
Chorus: dido
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why i..
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
It's not so bad..
1st chorus: volume gradually grows over raindrop background
2nd chorus: full volume with beat right after "thunder" noise
[eminem as 'stan']
Dear slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up?  man how's your daughter? 
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what i'ma call her? 
I'ma name her bonnie
I read about your uncle ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is stan
{chorus: dido}
[eminem as 'stan']
Dear slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
Four hours and you just said, "no."
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in denver - you said if I'd write you
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, stan -- p.s.
We should be together too
{chorus: dido}
[eminem as 'stan']
Dear mister-i'm-too-good-to-call-or-write-my-fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it? 
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? 
You know the song by phil collins, "in the air of the night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him? 
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped +all+ of your pictures off the wall
I love you slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See slim; {*screaming*} shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
Hey slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out? 
{*car tires squeal*} {*crash*}
.. {*brief silence*} .. {*loud splash*}
{chorus: dido}
[eminem]
Dear stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? 
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? 
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
C'mon - how fucked up is you? 
You got some issues stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together? 
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but stan
Why are you so mad?  try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Damn!
We'll lyrically blast...
Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shakin' that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit face-ted
Pasted, blasted, puke, drink, throw up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated them hips
And licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit
Two to the one, from the one, to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one, to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'ma continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights blind
We about to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck I say
Every day she be givin' it up
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rininse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish, shh
Yeah, me and Nate D-O double G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party
We about to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
I heard she was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
We bout' to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck I say
Every day she be givin' it up
There she goes, shakin' that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
God, I'm old
I ain't leavin' without you bitch
Come here, home with me
And my boy, and his boy, and his boy, and his girl, haha
Nate Dogg
(Verse 1)
You think its all over. You see Missy and Jessica Alba in honey getting it on. But you cant find the dam reasons to fuck it on
(Chrous)
All about it people, let me hear you sing. All about it let me hear you say shit! YO ALL ABOUT IT
(Verse 2)
I could never find a fucking reason to stay alive. I saw Lindsay Loham in the new movie, i never saw a bud like that. But thats all about it
(Chrous x 2)
(Verse 3)
ALL ABOUT IT
LET ME HEAR YOU SING SHIT
WOW, WOW, WOW 
(Chorus x 2)
Now when i was a little boy. I saw you, and let me tell you it was All about it
If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and now I'm back sitting on square one
Trying to pick myself up where I started from
I never would've thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more sort of chalant type I chose
To more shows, on the true nights I suppose
That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire and
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord, knows I was right 'cuz you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't beleive I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a poopie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewlery off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat, as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt, and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord, knows I was right 'cuz you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me
Yeah, right bitch, spend some time on my dick
In most cases Stat's attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public
We sufferin' because of this Shorty's on some hole another shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma tricked off rip
I'll admit I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feeding you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close but who could've predicted to know
Your triflin' way would've stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hoes, nope
Em introduced us, "50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50"
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, "You have very nice lips"
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some as
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported, you know how I grind
She got the talkin', talkin' like an opportunitist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord, knows I was right 'cuz you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
Eminem singing]
There's an intruder
in my house
He cut my phone-lines
can't dial out
I scream for police
but I doubt
They're gonna hear me
when I shout
[rapping]
A couple of cocktails have sent me to jail
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
there's a doberman pincher and a pitbull in the seat
these pigs'll get bit for fooling with me
quit fooling with me
Bitch, you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
and which you're gonna see in the long run
Im'a be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass
flashin that flash-light on my ass where was you at
last night when the ass wholes 
ran up on my grass
rapper slash actor
kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what I'm posed to fight with bear palms?
yeah right
they coming with bombs, I'm comin with flare-guns
We as americans

Look how our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America 
And we are Americans
Im'a make Vuku bucks

Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
but you know who
whith an "S" tatooed to my chest
But I've Finessed It
Now I got the Industry pissy
eversince me and Dre split it 50/50 on 50 it's funny
We got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead
It's never been said 
but I said precedents understanders
and they can't stand it
My name should've been bastard
the shit should've been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap put in my ass
but I'm too swift and fast 
for that one bastard
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit
I done seen a fast this rap shit
can turn into some pap-pap shit
that quick 
snap click
but this time they got fucking auto-ma-tic
(jamaican) and no one gon' test this mon
Clack

I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
under my Long Johns 
under my Sean Johns
when running with the long arm or the long long gone
Im'a do five years or less than that
no questions asked
it might be a good idea that I stop right here
and quit while I'm ahead

already got a steady infrared nipped on my head
A target on my back

Bin Laden on my ass

We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'd be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt befo' ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' ho's
Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same?
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open that I won't be makin' a mistake
'Cause I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you, right at you
So after a year and 6 months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much, it hurts, never mistreated you once
I'll pour my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
Til' I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't a possible reason I can think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I would've did anything for you to show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cuz I'm a
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you
[Bizarre] 
Yeah...ha ha ha (BANG!), Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you 
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha 
No one's iller than me (wha?) 
No one, no one is iller than me 
No one is iller than me 
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313... 
[Swift] 
I make rappers wanna turn into singers 
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers 
Bring this competition and face this meanin' 
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas 
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius 
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters 
Keep it close, you can't beat us 
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this 
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects 
While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret 
That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state 
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate 
I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell 
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals 
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail 
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well 
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials 
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels 
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now 
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how? 
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild 
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW! 
It's Swifty from the 313 
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh! 
[Bizarre] 
Me and Eminem and Mike 
Drivin' down Van Dyke 
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite 
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason 
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin' 
Last week this old man I had to blast 
'cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas 
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook 
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook 
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack 
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at 
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should 
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good! 
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route 
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell "EVERYBODY GET OUT"! 
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece 
'cause she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece 
No one, no one's iller than me 
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313 
No one, no one is iller than me 
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313 
[Eminem] 
Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy 
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly 
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs 
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs 
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs 
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs 
Down a fifth, crack open a six 
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss 
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends 
Who gives a fuck who they was 
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does 
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz? 
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz 
Mics get sandblasted 
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid 
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it 
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket 
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted 
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic 
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic 
Furious four motherfuckers 
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters 
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me 
[Fuzz] 
I run shit like an ass with legs 
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red 
Similar to your ass in a casket dead 
Drastic spread of acid heads 
Come to abort you like a bastard egg 
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs 
Ask the feds from past the edge 
Rockin' the most classic threads 
Flashin' bread, roll down the window 
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red 
You can get 'til that ass get red 
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him 
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem 
Never writer's block, I block writers 
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters 
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick 
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK! 
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' "Stop it..." 
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit 
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick 
Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits 
I shoot a rocket through your optic 
You niggaz still don't know the top pick? 
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass 
And have you shittin' socks bitch! 
We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split 
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits 
(No one...) 
Ain't nobody iller than me 
[Bizzare] 
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313 
No one, no one is iller than me 
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313 
No one, no one is iller than me 
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313 
You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees! 
From the home of potholes and trash 
We'll lyrically blast... 
How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges
He`s already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem
Well, to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They`ve compelled me to kill this elderly man
And i get these panic attacks
Pop a xanax, relax
Tryna stick my ****in` dick inside a mannequin`s ass
Then i get manic depressed
See the orthodontist get gassed
Man, it`s kickass
The first thing i put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain`t too late to have a change of face
And take it off and show my face so you can see the things you facin`
Slice you up and cook you after you`re murdered by strangulation
That`s bacon souffle you makin`, ain`t you? well, thank you jason
There goes one more coma
Due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more soma
And i`ll be done for, mama
Go in the damn broom closet
Another valium, lost it
Shovin` the vacuum nozzle
Down the bathroom faucet
Seems like every day i get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me the 18 month old baby, come shake `em up
It`ll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breakin` his neck in eightysome places
Baby, he`s shady comes lady
He`s got the razor-b-blades and the ch-ch-chain-ch-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling m-m-mumbling dum-dum
Yeah, here i come-come, you hear the rumbling? vrum-vrum
There`s something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum
My head and torso are some won` where they come from
Who`s it belong to, maybe the girl with the long blonde hair
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly there`s some` wrong
`cause she didn`t come home
She`s missing
Where is she
Something fishy is goin` on
I guess he stuck the xxxxx with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song
Come o
[Lotto]
Yo, it's time to get rid of this coward right here once and for all.
I'm sick of the motha fucka! Check this shit out!
Yo! I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me!
This shit is a horror flick, but a black guy doesn't die in this movie!
Fuckin' wit Lotto, dawg, you gotta be kiddin!
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin!
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joining the KKK.
On some real shit, though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck 'Lotto,' call me your leader
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from "Leave It to Beaver"
I used to like that show, now you got me in a fight back' mode
But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go!
I hate to do this; I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well that ends ok?
So I'll end this shit with a "Fuck you, but have a nice day!"
[Rabbit]
Word, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskal, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid!
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid!
"Blahbity bloo blah blah blahbity blooh blah!"
I ain't hear a word you said, "hipidy hooblah!"
Is that a tank top, or a new bra?
Look Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boob job!
Didn't you listen to the last round, meat head?
Pay attention, you're saying the same shit that he said!
Matter fact, dog here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful,
And don't come back until something dope hits you
Fuck it! You can take the mic home with you!
Looking like a cyclone hit you,
Tank top screamin', "Lotto, I don't fit you!"
You see how far them white jokes get you?
Boys like How Vanilla Ice gonna diss you? 
My motto: Fuck Lotto!
I'll get the 7 digits from your mother for a dolla' tomorrow!
Shady!

The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend ****, it's friendship, mi nemesis is su nemesis
Ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this **** is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When there's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin' the most current people
On their shoulders and their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody

Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Homie I'll survive everything you got in that ch*****
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talking sh** now the squad called me
Enough holdin' back the steam, Em' let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a f****** G?
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shattered, I'm a walkin' chick magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?

Talk of New York, Tony Yayo
[Eminem]
This motherfucker here, just wont shut up will you? 
Talk about I owe you, bitch you owe me 
I'm promoting you right now 
Yo lets put the nail in his coffin 
[Chorus]
I dont want to be like this 
I dont really want to hurt no feelins 
But Im only bein real when I say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope) 
And old men have heart attacks 
and I dont want to be responsible for that so 
Put the mic down and walk away 
You can still have a little bit of dignity 
[verse 1]
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino 
an 83 year old fake Pacino 
So how can he hold me over some balcony 
without throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me 
Please dont, youl probably fall with me 
and our asses will both be history 
But then again youll finally get your wish 
'cause you be all over the street like 50 Cent 
Fuckin punk pussy fuck you chump 
gimme a one-on-one see if I dont fuck you up 
Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up 
And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck 
dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin 
You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin 
and beggin motherfuckers for guest appearences 
and you can even get the clearances 'cause real lyricists 
dont even respect you or take you serious 
Its not that we dont like you, we hate you - period 
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn 
last week you was shakin Obie Trice's hand 
Now hes a busta? What the fucks with that? 
Get on a track dissin us kissin 50's ass 
and askin me what I know about inditements-bite me 
bitch I got two cases, and probation - fight me! 
What do I know about standin in front of a judge like a man 
ready to take whatever sentence he hands 
What you know about your wife slicin her wrists 
right in front of the only thing that you have in this world - a little girl? 
And I put that on her, when this is all over 
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her 
I dont know shit about no shoppin rocks 
But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin spots? 
When your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin 
pressin up your own flyers and your stickers stickin 
them bitches up after spendin six hours at Kinkos 
Just makin copys of your covers of casette singles 
to sell them out the trunk of your Tracer 
Spendin your whole paychecks at Disc Makers 
What you know about bein bullied over half your life? 
Oh thats right, you **should** know what thats like, your half white 
Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice, Im eaten you alive inside 
Jesus Christ, if your that much of a gangster, put the mic down 
You should be out killin motherfuckers right now 
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill'em dead bitch 
Shoot'em in the fuckin head, go ahead bitch 
Slap my mom, slap the f*ck out of her! 
She cant sue you, she wouldnt get a buck out of you 
'cause your broke as fuck you suck youre a fuckin joke 
If you was really sellin coke, well then what the fuck 
you stop for dummy? If you slew some crack 
you'd make alot more money than you do from rap 
You'll never had no security, you'll never be famous 
You'l never now what its like to be rich, lifes a bitch aint it? 
Raymond, here, let me break this shit down in lamens 
terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this 
and Canibus aint usin too many complicated fuckin words for you 
Here then let me slow it down for you 
so you can understand if I say it slower: 
Let it go dawg it's over 
[Chorus]
[Eminem talkin]
Haha 
Talkin bout I have motherfuckers callin your crib 
bitch you aint even got a fuckin crib 
You ain't even got a fuckin phone
Fuckin punk, threatening to shut me down at your fuckin lil' source magazine
If I come back & want me to attack you, bitch you attacked me first
take it like a man and shut the fuck up 
and fuck your little magazine too 
I dont need your little fuckin magazine, I got XXL's number anywayz 
And yall cant stand it 'cause their gettin bigger than yall 
oh, and by the way, how'd I look on the VMAs? 
When you was watchin me from whatever fuckin TV you was watchin me from in 
Boston 
The mean streets of Boston, fuckin sissy 
And you got us scared up in here motherfucker, suck our motherfuckin dicks 
Oh, and for those that dont know, dont get it twisted yo... The Source has a 
white owner!
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Ahem, excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class
For one second?
Hi kids, do you like violence?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails
Through each one of my eyelids?
(Uh, huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
(Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
(Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
(Umm)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead"
Uh, uhh, So why's your face red?  Man you wasted
Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard
I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut
(Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
(Oww)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin' over pedestrians
In a spaceship while they screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
(Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Aah)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away
(Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
(Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'?  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
(Hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
(C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me, mom?
(Wah)
You ain't got no tits
(Wah)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steamin' mad
And by the way when you see my dad?
(Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
Hi, my name is, my name is
(What? Who?)
My name is Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, my name is
(Huh? What?)
My name is Slim Shady
* the original appears on Eminem's "Slim Shady EP" on Web Entertainment
Chorus: Eminem (repeat 4X)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
[Eminem]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description and sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze"
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in "Set It Off" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: "Son, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a ;ick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin "TRUCE TRUCE"
and surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me!  It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps
Chorus
Chorus (repeats again to fade)
Hello
What up?
Hello? Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back
I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon
The FBI might be trying to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do you can say good night and bye bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth of walking dead man
Blank stair, dead pan, look on my face as I gaze into space
As I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere
And I'll go down in the history
As the bloodsucking leech who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dying the villain, not the hero
Splendid, stupendous way to end this, I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flashback to September 7th when 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like that day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the greatest lunatic with a **** who just happened
To work on the same block in the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
**** from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they who's they, for 'em to say, touche'
We're all vulnerable and its spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay, as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, you can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothing
When it's time, it's your time
You are the prime target, you have become Public Enemy #1
Okay, guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop, pajama time
Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's okay
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
It's Friday and it's my day
Used to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?
Man you must be up out yo mind
Dre, ah, ah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby (ah ah)
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' "Ah ah ah ah"
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said. "Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's '8 Mile' now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit
Oh you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba
I don't have any lines to go right here so tubba
Tellytubby fellas, what, fellas, what
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous what
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'
It's the season, just go ah ah ah ah, it's so appeasin'
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby, baby
(Ah ah)
Touch my body, touch my body
Oh boy just touch my body, I mean girl just touch my body
Y'all know me, still the same O.G.
But I been low key
Hated on by most these niggaz wit' no cheese
No deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles
And no ski's
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family
With groceries
Got a crib wit' a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, "Mother, fuck tha police"
Gave you tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggaz that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't gettin' no sleep
so fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucki' around wit' me
And turn me back to the old me
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
So what do you say to somebody you hate
(What?)
Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?
(Yup)
Then just study a tape of N.W.A.
One day I was walkin' by, wit' a Walkman on
When I caught a guy, give me an awkward eye
(What you lookin' at?)
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot
Wit' his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryin' to park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out wit' two broken legs, tryin' to walk it off
"Fuck you too bitch, call the cops"
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit' a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
(Right here)
From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death wit' a Charleston Chew
Slim shady, hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men, ladies, sorry Doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailie
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
If it was up to me
You muh'fuckers would stop comin' up to me
Wit' your hands out lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of
(Compton)
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all?
'Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What 'cause I been in the lab wit' a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that, this is the millenium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap! You can have it back
So where's all the Madd Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped wit' gats
When you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
So I'm out the game huh?
Huh? Yo Dre, we ridin'
Whatever
Haha! Well I'm witcha homies
Okay, let's handle the small shit
I was born to brew up storms and stir up shit
Kick up dust, 'cos 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick went through too much do too much shit
Corrupt, and I'm a pour it on like syrup bitch!
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Butters worth
Dre told me to milk the shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
And if I fumble the verse, keep goin'
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled no punches that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep wit me, as we take a lil' trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
(But what about Jermaine?)
Fuck Jermaine!
He don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think, I don't read
Your lil' interviews, and see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, Mini-me with a bunch of little Mini-yous
Runnin' around your backyard swimmin' pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh huh huh huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh huh huh huh?
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie Cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a duori
We'll rub it in, every club you're in will have you
Blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin' gain
Dre ain't havin' it, long as I'm here to play Devil's Advocate
If there was some magic shit
I could wave over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucka punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
'Cause I know if they get up I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck! White 'Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill'
And grow up, to be Atilla, go nuts and be a pillar
And I'm, somethin' of a phenom'
One puff of the chron', I'm unstoppable
I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us
(Come on!)
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh huh huh huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh huh huh huh?
Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Aliza, partyin' all day
But I handle my business 'cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it
And you die tryin' to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Heh, like my old lady
'Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, dependin' on your mood if it swings
Think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed right and my loose leaf's my launchpad
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything, catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, and invest
In somethin' to protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm best
In the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death
Five mics in the source? Ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I'll breathe to collect a fuckin' check
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh huh huh huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you were sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh huh huh huh?
Watch your fuckin' mouth
Yo this Timbaland, tell them I said suck my dick!
People!  It feels so good to be back
Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing the new
And improved, you know who
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the center piece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Can a bitch don't want no beef with Slim
No! Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From sÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©ance to sÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©ance
C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down
C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down
Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back
The Boogiemonster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face in, push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin
You might not like, this white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do si do, oh yo ho, hello there
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins, hijackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their navy
You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eatin their food and their baked beans
I'm twenty-eight, they gon'
Take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane, or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me
C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down
C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down
Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more, or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me shoot me
Psychotic hypnotic product, I got it the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God I talk a lotta hum de lay de la la
Oochie walla walla, um di da dah da dah but you gotta gotta
Keep movin, there's more music to make
Keep makin new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hungry, like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny, I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing, pass the KY
Let's get ready for some intense, serious ass fucking!
(Dr. Dre)
Wants to square dance with me
(Nasty nas)
Wants to square dance with me
(X to the Z)
Wants to square dance with me
(Busta rhymes)
Wants to square dance with me
(Cana bitch)
Won't square dance with me
(Fan a bitch)
Won't square dance with me
(Canada bis)
Don't want no parts of me
Dirty dozen
Wants to square dance with you
Yee haw
Man, I need a lighter, man, right here
Yeah, whassup, Slim? What's crackin'?
Hit this shit, shit, I almost hit this motherfucker today
Is that right? What is it with motherfuckers thinkin' that
Because we're in the spotlight or whatever that
They can do or say whatever they want to us
And that we won't retaliate
Protect my motherfuckin' self
By any means, necessary, right?
'Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
'Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do
'Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
'Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do
Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Bein' underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight but seem to receive nothin' but hate
Millionaires snatchin' crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin' up for my shows
You know how it goes, I might as well kick it at home
But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me
(Yeah)
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin' for what so I can blow up
Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
Fuck that, this the fuckin' thanks I get
For tryin' to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
Yo, I feel like my whole life is upside down
(Upside down)
'Cause you seein' more support than I'm seein' my child
It's like everyday I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin' this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulance up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
Whether it's unloaded full or an unregistered one
No bullet, you're so full of shit
This clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit, I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin' lot with a dude
Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
Don't tell me bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch
'Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
'Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do
'Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
'Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do
This ain't business, this is personal bitch
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very fucked up day, I'm needin' this fit
Shuttin' motherfuckers up like they pleadin' the 5th
Yo Em, it's time to get serious with it
(Yeah)
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love, lost my niggaz, relax yourself
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin' the wealth
To my niggaz who never seen it, I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs, about my guns and my loved ones
Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin' your channel, you played like a fuckin' piano
Ridin' slow through Cali like I'm ridin' a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele', nigga, soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin' dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
A front door with twelve locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
and one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place
Tryin' to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not
Gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And it's a disgrace, Hailey can't play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin' by honkin' your horn
Screamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' 'n' shit
Or pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the Internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them
That if someone comes to my crib
I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
"Oh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans
Just for tryin' to stand on his porch"
And I'm the bad guy 'cause
I don't answer my door like "Hey, hi!
You guys wants some autographs?
Okay, form a straight line"
Sometimes I feel like loadin' this rifle
And climbin' the roof at night
And hidin' outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you
It's just that I'm not behind the mic
I'm a person who's just like you
{Call this mother fucker
Ohh fuck yeah
Give 'em a piece of my mind
A piece of my ass
(Thanks for waiting)
(Sir, may I help you?)
Ohh thank you
I need to make a collect call
(What number?)
Ohh
The number's 6 2
(At the tone, please say your name)
Kenneth Kaniff from Connecticut
Automated piece of shit}
{(Yo)
Hey there cock boy

[Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noooooise!
Aww shit, yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
out and relapse 'til I act Jack Daniels and yack
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in
trouble! What's occurrin before, after, and durin' the show
has no bearing on the bad news I'm baring, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushin you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion to blow
Now stomp your fuckin feet 'til you get to squishin a hoe
It's pandemonium standin O when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're givin me wood
You should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm coppin over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spittin the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop fakin the funk and start shakin your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian of rap
and Just Blaze on the track, what the fuck's more amazin than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?
[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy Io' fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the linin
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69'in
It's like Rick James is shootin up your house nigga!
[rapid gunfire] FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!
You're screamin fuck the world with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shovin my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred, immune in mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eatin
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like a Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touchin that
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the FUCK you at?
[Joell Ortiz]
I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art, of you nice swear (?)
Is that weird cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishin off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waitin to be hooked to IV as (?) well when you look at my pee
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shit it, I did it again, when I lit up this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Eminem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgustin hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?
[Crooked I]
I'm right here lettin the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll bite my bitch in the ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, at South Line
We do it to try to do without tryin
(Slaughterhouse!) Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's, Jumpoff Joe Beezy?
'Cause some things just, don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
Some on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game
Woah, oh, shouldn't be difficult to explain just why
You came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game cold as ice, you remain
Fuck em' all, tell em' all eat shit, here we go again
You can get the dick, just call me the ball sack
I'm nuts, Michael vick in this bitch
Dog fall back your mutts, fuck your worms
You've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck, it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble them up tric, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, yummy
You get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance while I diss you to the beat
Fuck the words you don't listen to em' anyway
Yeah, I struck a nerve sucka
Muhfucka might as well let my lips pucker like Elton John
'Cuz I'm just a mean cock sucka this shit is on
'Cuz you went and pissed me off, now I'm sittin' and pissin on
Everybody, give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So butt the Buddha light a bong but take a look at Mariah
Next time I inspire you to write a song come on
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm as cold as a cold wind
Blows when it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why and man I just don't know
No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm as cold as a cold wind blows
I don't knowblo, blo, blows blo, blo blows
Oh, oh, oh
Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon Bruce Banners back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standing
I set the world on fire piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle but I'm not fuckin' around
Muhfucka, I show your pussy footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt till' it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is it pushin'? You must have
Mistook me for some sissy soft punk
Lookin' for some nookie or bussum
Go ahead fuckin' hater push me
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot 'cuz I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy g's pull your car and just freeze up
Put your hoes down, shady ease up
Man, chill, nah I can't god dammit rap is a landfill
Drop that anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world will stop spinning and Michael J
Fox will come to a stand still
During that earthquake, urine in your face cuz your fake
Ahhh, what the fuck that hurt, wait
Ahhh, what the fuck, I just got struck by lightning
Alright then I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do now forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you, you can repent
But I warn you, if you continue to hell I send you
And just then the wind blew and I said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm as cold as a cold wind
Blows when it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why and man I just don't know
No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm as cold as a cold wind blows
Blo, blo, blows blo, blo blows
Oh, oh, oh
How long will I be this way, shady, it's in my dying days
Till I hang up the mic and it's not for me to say
So long till then I drop the fuckin bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing a long slut, this slut that not the worst of this song
Oh, bitches don't like that
Homie, I'll be nicer to women when aquaman drowns
And human torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul I roll solo so
Don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums
Yeah, I'm bananas pussy cut off the grapes and grow a pear
But I swear, you try to diss me I slaughter you
I'll put that on everything, like everyone does with autotune
The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm as cold as a cold wind
Blows when it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why and man I just don't know
No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm as cold as a cold wind blows
Blo, blo, blows blo, blo blows
Oh, oh, oh
I don't know, I don't know wat caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I dunno, I dunno but I'll probly be this way till my dying day
I dunno why I'm so, I'm so cold, mean things I don't need to say
I guess this is how you made me
Well I just heard the news today 
It seems my life is going to change 
I closed my eyes, begin to pray 
Then tears of joy stream down my face 
With arms wide open 
Under the sunlight 
Welcome to this place 
I'll show you everything 
With arms wide open 
With arms wide open 
Well I don't know if I'm ready 
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath, I'll take her by my side 
We stand in awe, we've created life 
With arms wide open
Under the sunlight 
Welcome to this place 
I'll show you everything 
With arms wide open 
Now everything has changed 
I'll show you love 
I'll show you everything 
With arms wide open 
With arms wide open 
I'll show you everything ...oh yeah
With arms wide open..wide open 
[Guitar Break]
If I had just one wish 
Only one demand
I hope he's not like me 
I hope he understands 
That he can take this life 
And hold it by the hand 
And he can greet the world 
With arms wide open... 
With arms wide open
Under the sunlight 
Welcome to this place 
I'll show you everything 
With arms wide open 
Now everything has changed 
I'll show you love 
I'll show you everything 
With arms wide open 
With arms wide open 
I'll show you everything..oh yeah
With arms wide open....wide open
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits,
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks,
Everytime I go to get up I just fall in piss,
My life's like one great big ball of shit,
If I could just put it all in all I spit,
Instead I always try to swallow it,
Instead of staring at this wall and shit,
While I sit writers block sick of all this shit,
Can't call it shit.
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall,
If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits.
This is it, last straw, thats all, thats it.
I ain't dealing with another fucking politic.
I'm like a skillet, bubblin' until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up,
Blow this building up, I've been sealed enough,
My cup runneth over and filled it up,
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
But I'm a show you what, you gonna feel my rush,
You don't feel it then it must be too real to touch,
Feel to touch, I'm about to tear shit up,
Goosebumps, yeah I'm make your hair sit up,
Yeah sit up, I'm a tell you who I be,
I'm make you hate me cause you ain't me,
You wait, it ain't to late to finally see,
What you close minded fucks were too blind to see,
Whoever finds me, is gonna get a finders fee,
Out this world and ain't no one out their mind as me,
You need peace of mind, well here's a piece of mine,
All I need's a line, but sometimes,
I don't always find the words to rhyme,
To express how I'm really feeling at that time,
Yeah sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, 
just sometimes, Its always me, 
how dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, 1, 2, then half past 3,
This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper, (tear)
I'm desperate at my desk 
if I could just get the rest, of this shit off my chest, again, 
stuck in this slum, Cant think of nothing, 
fuck I'm stumped, but wait here comes something,
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out, new pad,
crinkle it up, and throw that shit out,
I'm fizzling now, thought I had figured it out,
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out,
But I'm afraid, why am I afraid? 
why am I a slave to this trade?
Sign that I'll spit to the grave, real enough to rattle you up,
Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want.
I'm a switch hitter, bitch, 
jimmy smith ain't a quitter,
I'm a sit here till I get enough
For me to finally hit a fucking boiling point,
Put some oil in your joints,
Flip the coin bitch come get destroyed,
An MC's worst dream: I make them tense
they hate me, see me and shake like a chain link fence,
By the looks of them you would swear Jaws was coming,
By the screams of them you would swear I'm sawing someone,
By the way they running you would swear the law was coming,
Its now or never tonight is all or nothing,
Momma, Jimmy keep leaving on us, he said he'd be back,
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest,
I'll back baby I just got to beat this clock,
Fuck this clock, I'm'a make them eat this watch,
Don't believe me? Watch. 
I'm a win this race, And I'm a come back 
and rub my shit in your face, Bitch.
I found my nitch, 
You gonna hear my voice
Till you sick of it you ain't gonna have a choice,
If I gotta scream till I have half a lung,
If I have half a chance I grab it, rabbit run...
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah, yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See, they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now, ain't you momma?
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha, I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' C.D.
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Coz he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cuz I'da killed him, shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show'
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that C.D. for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me ma?
But guess what? You're gettin older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time
I said, I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

[laughing]
Ay yo 50

[chorus]
Monkey see monkey do

If they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
Now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up
Check-mate motherfucker
Games over
We won
Tweedle-de-tweedle-dum
It doesnt take much
For me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You aint even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers
Like smearing blood stains with a paint brush
I cant explain what it is my brain does
But however it works its insane
Its plain nutz
And it aint just my brain thas dangerous
Its a whole combination of things
It takes nutz
And im not affriad to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
Im patiently waiting for the day
Im anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs
When you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk
Ya aint tough
Whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas
This is me talking motherfucker
This aint drugs
You wanna pop, shit wake-up, then make-up
FUCK THAT
Its too late chump now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does
Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
Till i pull the paint off
I never been shot
But i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
Cause ive always came off
Like ja's chain
When they try to rush him and lost
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I dont stop
The only thing i wait for
Is day that i dont gotta report to probate court
Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more
Cause ive been holding my tounge till i got a sprained jaw
Alot of rappers on my list that just aint ja
And ima read that motherfucker off from april
You pussies think i went soft since 8 mile
When i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls
Trust me
[chorus]
Monkey see monkey do
Dont ever make the first move
Just let em' come to you
Cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do
So let em' come to you
The rest of us follow suit
Monkey see monkey do
Tweedle-de-tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
Now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up

Intro: (Obie Trice)
ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"Obie Trice, real name no gimmicksÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
Refrain 1
2 trailer park girls go round the inside, round the inside, round the inside 
(Repeat Refrain 1)
Refrain 2
Guess who's black, black again? Smiley's black, tell a friend. Guess who's 
black, guess who's black, Guess who's black, guess who's black, Guess who's 
black, guess who's black, guess who's black
Verse 1
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Shady no more 
They want Smiley I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Smiley, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of seeds mixed with some hard liquor
Some binaca that'll jumpstart my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the Hospital
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating
When he's rocking the table while I'm masturbating (Hey!)
You waited this long so stop debating
'cause I'm back, I'm on a fag and ejaculating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me leave, or let me be me so watch me flee
They tried to shut me down on EmTV, but it feels so empty with Smiley
So come on you prick, jump on a dick rotate, on the dick and suck some dick
And get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy 
I just got in all cop pursuits, ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"FUCK YOU DEBBIE!ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
Chorus x2
Now this ain't like a job for me
So everybody just let me be
'cause we need a little penis envy
'cause it feels so empty with Smiley
Verse 2
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoner's pelvis
'Till someone comes along a mission and yells ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"dickÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
A missionary, vision is scary, could start a resolution
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and tact, in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask Smiley?
Well, I'm black
(Batman sound) Fix your bent antennae tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in 
and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of perfection, back for the winter I'm interesting
The less thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and resting
Testing ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"Attention PleaseÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚ feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents and my ass cheeks are free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent Smiley?
Chorus x2
Verse 3
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's taking this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass flipped
Worse than 'em little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get bombed by Dolby
This 36-year-old bald headed fag sold me
He don't know me, he's too old, let it go, move over, nobody listens to Techno
Now let's go, just give weed the signal, I'll be there with a whole crew full 
of new imbeciles
I've been doped, suspenseful with a pencil ever since Prince turn himself into 
a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems, everybody only wants to disgust me
So this must mean I'm Smite Smiley
But it's just me I'm just smiling
Though I'm not the first queen of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself healthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers submerge
But it matters how many fish in the sea
When it will be so empty with Smiley
Chorus x2
(Hum dei dei la la, Hum dei dei la laÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¦ la la la) x2 ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"KidsÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
Get the fuck out motherfucker...
Verse 1
Hey yo...
When I step up in the bar, everybody hit the fucking floor,
Lucky motherfuckers make it to the door,
Cause when I spit on mic's I spit raw,
Which cause confusion from the bar to the dance floor,
I keep the club on the vex,
Cause he gotta pay me when I spit, plus replace alot of shit,
Niggas get a whiling,
When my words echo's the room like, get your hand out my pocket,
You suck shit when my topics rockin,
I'm banned from clubs 'cause my toxic tonsils,
Loud speaker like a fucking sports announcer,
I spit the baa-haa till you rush the bouncer,
I rush the mutherfucker in your way who's bouncing,
You know old christ get their yak's pronouncin...
Chorus
Get live motherfucker when I speak motherfucker,
Out your seat motherfucker, I'm a reach motherfucker,
Shady-records till I sleep motherfuckers
Obi-trice nothin but street motherfucker
Tear this bitch up till you bleed motherfucker
I would'nt give a fuck who you be motherfucker
Punk, pussy, bitch or g motherfucker
Adrenaline rush before you leave motherfucker
Verse 2
When I speak I blow out your tweeters, yo dog,
Show out in speakers roll out with heaters,
I'm just an animal eating the game,
Jumbo monkey, funky and obie's the name,
I rose solo, never been a hoe though,
Keep yak's vocal when cats act loco,
Where you at when I'm moving the crowd,
You get trampled, mashed on detroit style,
Up out your seats, pump out the e's,
Off the beat's the crowd overpleased,
Where my nigga's at smoking them tree's,
Off the cognac, finger fucking the ski's,
That's how it is when you party with me,
You don't like it, you l-7 like a square beat...
Chorus
Verse 3
Yo, yo, since I came I rearrange the place with blaze,
Spays dope with coke-fevers dna, I'm so addicted,
To gettin nigga's lifted, drunk off a liquid,
Obie trice the misfit,
Douse'in the crowd with piss and voul's,
We underground motherfucker fix your frown's,
I beat the bore with a wisty tour,
Off a whisky you never been this deep before,
So throw up your hands and peep out your man's
When I come through next quarter trust it in you's,
And trust I'm attackin it,
I hook up the hot shit like ay see we havin it,
That's why I'm so miraculous,
And hope to get you nigga's pumped up,
I see you next time I see him chump,
That's right, you go through obie trice fucked up,
On your knees drop for these...
Chorus
Mr. Yayo, you're free to go
So I guess this means I'll see you tomorrow, eh?
Yeah, ha ha, guess who's home?
Tony Yayo, yeah, Obie Trice come on
Here we go now
I'm a drama setter, grippin' my berretta
Sippin Armeretta, man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter I'll be the first to set it, homie
You can bet it, just don't get in the way
Of my cheddar, man, 'cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go looking for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying 'cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin up
'Cause I'm a drama setter
Told you man, I'm Riker's Island Pokemon
I got COs bringing me filet mignon
But now a nigga home lookin frail in the drop
(What up)
With a bitch shotgun that's inhaling the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got Glocks in the Lex so we ride behind cops
(Break it down now)
Broke days, we used to put water in our cereal
Now we're crossing borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montana on full body armor
Soning niggaz like Alfredo in The Godfather
Two shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
And the AR-15 bending your Six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children
I'm a drama setter, grippin my berretta
Sippin Armeretta, man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter I'll be the first to set it, homie
You can bet it, just don't get in the way
Of my cheddar, man, 'cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go looking for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying 'cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin up
'Cause I'm a drama setter
Since Yayo is home, them A-Rs is drawn
Obie's Gorilla-Unit, fuck affiliation
We are one, it is senseless for you to prevent this
The 40 cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperament
And we holding them Ks, that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged, they thow him in cages
But now my nigga's loose, our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils' baby blues
His short fuses put your portrait on the news
Nigga, them screws is loose when you fuckin with them Shady dudes
I'm a drama setter, grippin my berretta
Sippin Armeretta, man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter I'll be the first to set it, homie
You can bet it, just don't get in the way
Of my cheddar, man, 'cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go looking for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying 'cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin up
'Cause I'm a drama setter
I got fat while I was gone but now I'm here
And yall rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back, itchy fingers on the Mac
Get scrilla off of crack, get 50's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggaz amp you money
Cause I got niggaz in Queens that kill for Pamper money
Move like kaiser, Jayson Williams slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats
It's the rap tycoon, Tony y'all all know me
See me on MTV, I'm a parolee
I was out for twelve hours and went right back in
For three hots and one cot doing time in the pen
I'm a drama setter, grippin my berretta
Sippin Armeretta, man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter I'll be the first to set it, homie
You can bet it, just don't get in the way
Of my cheddar, man, 'cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go looking for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying 'cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin up
'Cause I'm a drama setter
Yeah, nigga, thank you Marshall
Ha ha, no problem, we don't stop, nah
Save the best for the last, talk of New York
Thoughts of a Predicate Felon, baby
Yeah, man
Blue Hefner, Lloyd Banks, you know
Buck Marley, Young Buck, Curtis 'Interscope' Jackson
'Shady-Aftermath' Mathers, ooh
Olivia, O. Trice, Stat Quo
We gonna keep getting this money
Y'all rappers gonna keep hatin
Fuck y'all, y'all want problems?
I'm built for this shit, Shady-Aftermath, G-Unit
We run this rap shit
Men singing:
Jealous! (8X)
Girls voice: (Talking over the singing)
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...
Verse 1:
I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me 
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?
Chorus: Men Singing
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (8X)
Women's Voice: (Talking over singing)
Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy
Verse 2:
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like 
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga** 
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
He goes, "You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"
Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...
Chorus: Men Singing
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (12X)
 
Your mother, you fuckin' fagot
La da da, da da da, da da
La da da, da da da, da da
La da da, da da da, da da
Aiyo, this next song is
Dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget
About you, you fuckin' homo
We still remember
There once was a man
Who liked to jump around
(Jump around)
But he got too old to jump up and down
(Up and down)
(So then what happened?)
So he put the mic down
And picked the guitar up
(Picked the guitar up)
(And then he what?)
Started singin' the blues
Like there's no tomorrow
(No tomorrow, come on)
Left his boys in the house of pain
(The house of pain)
It was the wisest decision he ever made
(Ever made)
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
(Could ever do)
Was try to buck a three-eighty
On those who act Shady
Tell me now, what you gonna do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old ass sing no more
I remember back when you had
The Knack
(Had the knack)
And I remember when you had
Your first heart attack
(Heart attack)
I was right there laughin'
When I heard the news
(Heard the news)
I just wish the cardiac
Would'a murdered you
(Would'a murdered you)
Maybe Ice-T's right
You are a bitch
(You are a bitch)
You come around when you're broke
And you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
(Could ever do)
Was try to buck a three-eighty
On those who act Shady
Tell me now, what you gonna do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old ass sing no more
Remember back in '94, like right before
Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When house of pain was out of fame
Like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard The Knack
And you were down with Syndicate
I went to get your shit, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous you dick less piece of shit,
How could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech
When I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin', then you left the room
And didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you was mad that someone else was
White and tried to rhyme or somethin'
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin' to steal your light or nothin'
But you're a homosexual, white rappin' Irish fagot
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a fagot too
Then I'd be confused as you
And I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you?
I never fucked with you
Why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you
What, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you
And I don't fuckin' sing
And probably play guitar better
And I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you
And maybe that will help me know
What it's like to sing the blues
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old ass sing no more
'Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
(Long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
Came along now, don't nobody
Wanna hear your old ass sing no more
You fuckin' punk, pussy
You fuckin' fagot, sissy, fuck
And by the way, a three-eighty's a fuckin' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun
You little bitch
Next time say
My fuckin' name in a song
Don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin' diss me
Diss me you fuckin' fagot
You fuckin' punk, pussy
You fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cunt
Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak and when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up but you gotta search within you
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
'Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop pinnin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'ma stop sendin' 'em
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hoch venom
Adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop killin' hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of 'Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my leg give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my leg give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'till my bone collapse
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spend
Tryin' to hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walkin' around like nothin's botherin me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect, you got to give me
The press' wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my leg give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my leg give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'till my bone collapse
Soon as the verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinkin'? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm a addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps who want some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my leg give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'till my bone collapse
'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
'Till my leg give out, can't shut my mouth
'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'till my bone collapse
Until the roof, until the roof, the roof comes off
The roof comes off, until my legs, until my legs
Give out from under me, I will not fall
I will stand tall, feels like no one can beat me
Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shakin' that *** on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get buzzed up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get the big funds
Get rubbed, zip it up, get wasted, sh** face-ted
Pasted, blasted, puke, drink, throw up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this chick gyrated them hips
And licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing somethin'
Two to the one, from the one, to the three
I like good ***** and I like good *****
S**** so much **** you wouldn't believe
And I get more *** than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one, to the three
I met a bad chick last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the *********** mountain top
Heard ************ talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'ma continue to rock
Getcha *** of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights blind
We about to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act ********
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the **** I say
Every day she be givin' it up
Shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
C'mon girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
Oh girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
C'mon girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rininse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish, shh
Yeah, me and Nate D-O double G
Lookin' for a couple chickens with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple a dese
Mix it with her bubbly, we finna finna have a
We about to have a party

I'm lookin' for a girl I can **** in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' ****
Some girls they act ********
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I want a ***** that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a s***, would you be mine?
I heard she was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a s***, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
Shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
C'mon girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
Oh girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
C'mon girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me

( Verse1 )
As I fall deeper into a manic state,
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait.
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate,
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate.
Start off with the NyQuil like 'I think I'll just have a taste'.
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate,
to a harder prescription drug called Valium like yeah that's great.
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight. 
Now I need something in my stomach cuz I haven't ate.
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak.
And you'd think that with all I have at stake,
Look at my daughters face...
'Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think!
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me.
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me.
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos,
and he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat'.
(Chorus Begin)
Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before.
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me,
soon as I go home and close the door.
Kinda feels like DÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â½jÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â½ Vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
but I can't and I wont say I tried but I know that's a lie cuz I don't,
and why I just don't know..... 
(Chorus End)
( Verse2 )
Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin' year.
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fuckin hear,
'Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers'.
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half buzzed for half of the time.
Who's that mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind,
to have another half of glass of wine sounds asinine, yeah I know.
But I never had no problem with alcohol.
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall.
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball.
Shit must have knocked me out cuz I didn't feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck am I hungover, and god damn i got a head ache. 
Shit half a vicodin why cant I? 
'All systems ready for take off please stand by'.
(Chorus Begin)
Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before.
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
soon as I go home and close the door.
Kinda feels like DÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â½jÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â½ Vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
but I cant and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cuz I don't,
and why I just don't know..... 
(Chorus End)
( Verse3 )
So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh. 
A couple weeks go by it aint even like im getting high.
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah im getting by.
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die.
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose Proof so you use.
There's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through.
It's twelve noon aint no harm in self inducing a snooze.
What else is new? Fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full blown relapse,
'Just get high until the kids get home from school holmes, relax'.
And since im convinced that I'm insomniac,
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps, 
just to be able to function throughout the day let's see 
that's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three.
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep.
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
has taken four years just too put out an album B. 
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath,
cuz that Christmas you know the Pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the Methadone ya think?
Or the Hydrocodone, you hide inside your pornos? 
Your VCR tape cases with your Ambien CR, great places to hide ain't it?
So you can lie to Haley, I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Elaina.
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn!
(Chorus Begin)
Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before.
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
soon as I go home and close the door.
Kinda feels like DÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â½jÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¯ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â½ Vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
but I cant and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cuz i don't,
and why I just don't know..... 
(Chorus End)
[Eminem] 
Yo  speed racer  97' burgundy Blazer 
Wanted for burglary  had to ditch the mercury tracer 
I'm on some low ish  
I'm fed up wit the being broke ish 
I'm not to joke wit 
Bitch  I don't sell crack  I smoke it 
My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits 
Too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets 
Loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted 
Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, "Who want it?" 
Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it 
My 9's at your frame,is that your chain? Run it 
Who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor? 
Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager 
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer 
Stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her 
( Right right right ! ! ! ) (( Ding ! ! ! )) 
The doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics 
I'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you, 
and I'ma make sure you come back for it 
So barricade your infants, put up some extra fences 
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses ( Ooh ) 
..Take em' on long vacation trips 
Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships 
Mess up your face and lips 
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split 
Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit ((Laughter)) 
Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone 
I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on 
I'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber 
I'm sick of the crap, what's Dr. Kevorkian's phone number? ( Ha.. Hot ) 
It feels so wrong 'cause it feel so right
But it's alright, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance, the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home
I'm that guy, man, shove a dime up in my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in your shirt, jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mud holes in your ass, girl, now let's cuddle
Blood curdling, you're gurgling in on your blood waddle
I do for my next trick, I'm feeling wonderful
I think I might just do something a little less subtle
Shove a fucking Tonka truck up a little kids butt hole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash Ambassador
Of the Valentine Day massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with an icicle and leave her lay in a blood bath
While I put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider Man mask, man, just imagine
The fun I can have with a strap on
Stick up a Kim Kardashians ass
And make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachios? Damn I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio, man rolling a fat one
Shady drop the magic marker, put the cap on
Goddamn man, are you that much of an asshole
It feels so wrong 'cause it feel so right
But it's alright, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance, the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teeny, eenie, weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make this shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me, homie, you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter, I'm tryna maneuver
The hoover up in your poop shoot, don't move or ya
Might get it stuck up so fuckin' far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to your gluteus
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Weeny smothered in peanut butter pudding on the tube of your
Eye shadow and that'd look nice, you shoulda seen it, mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a pleasin' art
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's with McDonald's
Jump in her lap and watch the Sopranos.
It feels so wrong 'cause it feel so right
But it's alright, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance, the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home
Shady, what are ya doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat, can't hide a clue in the back
Boom and assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon
Skewin' a rat, a cat, screwin' a baboon
You shouldn't ask, what is he doin' with that broom?
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair and
Make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'
Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?
Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you in baby talk?
'Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed
Kelly Pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti, dike? Well, I can pee-pee and write your name
It feels so wrong 'cause it feel so right
But it's alright, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance, the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, home
Fine, nobody wants to play with me?
Fuck you then, bitch
Guys, you're always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gon' make me, make me sad
Bad, I'm gonna cry, I'm crying
I'm gonna tell my mom
Mom
Chorus: Eminem (repeat 4X)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
[Eminem]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description and sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze"
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in "Set It Off" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: "Son, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a ;ick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin "TRUCE TRUCE"
and surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me!  It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps
Chorus
Chorus (repeats again to fade)
Yeah, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, I feel like dancing
I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's makin' me high
I said, I smell something in the air that's makin' me high
Okay, here we go, do re mi fa so, fa so la ti da so
Lyrical Rosco, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tic-tock so
Time to show you the most kick ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick ax, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe frozen six pack, with exacto
Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, zig zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home, my novato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected nor what you thought so
About time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
Your dreams are getting' fulfilled, ooh, I'm literally getting' the chills
Spittin' at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Llama
And be calm or bring drama a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please, don't upset me, mama, you lookin' sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra toppin' the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in and how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun?
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind
I said its the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
When I'm behind a mic, dynamite is what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryin' to light
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a Lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome
The spinning drama when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Starting from scratch and then endin' up at the end enough
Capable of bringin' a Pulitzer, strong believe a bullet's a
Titanium, cranium that's full of surprises
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos high
Good evenin', this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
All aboard, okay, next stop: my basement
Haha, I'll meet you down there
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough that you shame me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa-that-a-fucking daisy
That's a no-no even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A.B.
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's 'cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep up on ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all horny 'cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I oughta just be honest but
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both fagots
All these fucking voices in my head, I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass, hopped away
Somebody please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the scheisse, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a-now, not a chance, not today, son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million like it's worldwide,
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave, I'm
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryin' to find out, why now there's beef?
Mace in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em, just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling, "Stop!"
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fuckin'-A, even got a bidet to
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator
Guess Who
Did you Miss me?
Jessica Simpson sing the chorus
Dina Rea  (Eminem)
(CHORUS)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
PlayerÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ Who could really blame you (who could really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac or ant'-acid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic, is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady manÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¦ no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive Gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then Squish it, then pass it to her friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can
Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2, You're practically a 10
I know you want me girl,
In fact I see your grin
(Now come in girl)
(CHORUS)

The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my ventolin inhaler and 2 Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Brit f'rget K-Fed let's cut off the middle man
Forget him or your gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl pay them little atten-tion
A little did I mention, that Jennifer's in-
Love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim
(CHORUS)

I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you
Damn girl I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth(brrp)
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Lord help us he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about to flip
Jessica rest assure, Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me?
You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
(Now break it down girl)
(CHORUS)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)

Dr. Dre, 2020, Yeah
[Intro]
Uh..
Yeah..
I like the way you do that shorty (shorty)
Now can you do somethin' for me (uh)
I like the way you movin' girl
Show me how you do that girl
I like the way you do that shorty (uh)
Now can you do somethin' for me
[Chorus]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If i could, get her outta here i would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me i should
Get Low!
[Verse]
Yeah..
I'm in the 2006, brand new wagon
Lookin' for a diva to handle a dragon
And even if there's two of um, i'ma move in and bag um
Make sure i'm strapped, keep the Uz and the Magnum
Yeah the gun talk, but i'm talkin' 'bout the condom
They followin' me home with my dog right behind um
Have you ever seen a ass clap on a stallion
Another bad bitch half black and italian
I dont know if she likes me or my medallion
You think i give a fuck, i'm just tryna get a nut
I dont need no-one to build my self-esteem up
Im fresh out the hood, but fuck it its all good
Why you can use me, 'cause i'ma use you
For menage-a-twage, you know the usual
And if you do me maybe i'll do you
A favour and walk you outside, rightt
[Chorus]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If i could, get her outta here i would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me i should
Get Low!
[Verse]
Naa, i aint ever aite pussy before
But im close to the edge if she pushin' me Lord
Her body language is that a nigga stiff as a sword
So she cant be a angel this bitch is a fraud
Head prolly took a nigga on a trip to the morgue
Pussy good enough to drive out the Michigan Ford
As soon as i hit the door she's squeezin' my arm
Hoppin' all on a nigga like Christina Milian
It might take a couple rounds to make me get to calm
But when she does go to sleep she might need a alarm
'cause i'm gone, she wanna be with a don
But i'm stuck so i'ma keep it about me on a song
Aint nothin' wrong, with a lil' bumpin' and grindin'
Especially if they got somethin' behind um
Im high as hell, pussy drunk when i climb in
How a nigga unfortunate i'm in
[Chorus]
I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If i could, get her outta here i would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me i should
Get Low!
[Verse]
Shorty looks like she's datin' a fashion designer
Damn, she musta got that from her momma
You know me somewhere in the back with the Llama
Keeps one of the cats with the drama, i'ma
Get a lil' closer to her, ma look so sweet
She remind me of a lot of broads aint Monique
But a bird nigga tryna holla, they all speak
Do you write up her phone number down, they wont keep

The girly I fucked last year when her hair was curly 
Couldnt remember it 'cause I was Infinite
And I met ken Kaniff in Connecticut
He said his predicits and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"I like youÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€?...and then he walked up and said ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…" let me snake bite

You would hope to be....but hopefully I will rock globaly
And nationwide...thats why my ass is wide
Thats why your ass just died on the passanger side...
Like a fuckin ride...when it got shot up by a drive by
When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it

Nowadays everybody just wanna poke there nose in our business

DoinÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ a song with olÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢ boy on the song ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ…"New YorkÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚,
Man I thought you just did a song with them both?ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚
Man the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss Michael
You should get your ghetto pass revoked
I never had no ghetto pass you asshole
You really wanna know when I did live in the ghetto
I kept a trespassing charge up at the railroad tracks
So I suggest you get your facts straight before you go
This assuming u know
I aint grow up in no trailer park just cause I was poor
Man this is my testimony to those that donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢t know
Man it felt like they do
If not to feel compelled to go and speak on me too.
So this d-ck goes to you and this d-ck goes to you
And if you feel like you want it you can get it too
And when your through pass it to the person next to you
Hey yo Stat get on the Mic and come and spit a few
[Stat Quo]
Muthaf-ckers so quick to spit bullsh-t
Stat Quo whoÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â¢s this

Now testify to this
Let it bang when you hear, this is classic sh-t
Eminem-
Yeah ...
Definately definately definately dope...
Definately definately K-Mart
Yeah Yeah
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
hence if I should draw out a line any fences
if so to what extent, if any, should I go?
cause it's getting expensive 
being on the other side of the court room on the defensive
they say I cause extensive psycholgical nerve damage to the brain
when I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too god damn sensitive
it's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
and Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
and let's clear this up too I aint got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me 
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader and Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like its my fault cause of the way that 
I stuck him off in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman I killed Super... Man
and how ironic that I'd be the bad guy kryptonite
the green chronic
(Chorus)
Cause i aint got no legs 
or no brain
nice to meet you 
hi my name is...
i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is...
Rain Man
Now in the bible it says
thou shall now watch two lesbians in bed
have homosexual sex 
unless of course you were given the consent to join in
then of course it's intercourse and it bisexual sex
which isn't as bad as long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before, during, or after performing the act of that which 
is normally reffered to as such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by today kids
in a more derogatory way
but who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say
let ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre (what up?)
I got a question if i may (yeah)
is it gay to play putt putt golf with a friend (yeah)
and watch his butt butt when he tees off (yeah)
but but i aint done THAT
in football a quarterback yells out hut hut
while he reaches in another grown man's ass
grabs on his nuts, but just what if 
it was never meant, it was just an accident
but he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
his teeny, tiny, little, round hiney
and he didn't mean it but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and I don't need to go into any more details
but what if he pictured it as a female's butt
is that gay? I just need to clear things up
til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...
(Chorus)
Cause i aint got no legs 
or no brain
nice to meet you 
hi my name is...
i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is...
Rain Man
You find me offensive
I find you offensive...
shit this is the same verse, I just did this
when am I gonna come to my good senses?
probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
my spider senses telling me Spider-Man is nearby
and my plan is to get him next and open up a whoop ass canister
god damnit Dre where's the god damn beat (yeah) anyway
anyway I don't know how else to put it 
this is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy kryptonite, the green chronic
demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it, I got it
high-five Nick Lechey stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
and as she flew around the room like a balloon i'd
grab the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can 
and to my headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwhich
and I don't even gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shitttt
(Chorus)
Cause i aint got no legs 
or no brain
nice to meet you 
hi my name is...
i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is...
Rain Man

Maxine!! (Phone Rings) 
Maxine: Hello 
Denaun: Can I speak to Maxine? 
Maxine: Yeah this is me what's up? 
Denaun: What up? 
Maxine: Who dis? 
Denaun: Denaun 
Maxine: Yeah what's up? 
Denaun: What are you doing? 
Maxine: Nothing just laying in bed 
Denaun: Huh? 
Maxine: Nothing just laying in bed 
Denaun: Why? 
Maxine: I don't know thinking about something freaky to do 
Verse 1: Eminem 
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine 
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean 
Plus she got a sugar daddy 
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly 
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation 
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation 
When you step away son, she got her face done 
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if 
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you 
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice 
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency 
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee 
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it 
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!) 
Verse 2: Denaun Porter 
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is 
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit 
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night 
You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down 
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this 
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be 
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that 
When you got niggas hiding in your closet 
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely 
Verse 3: 3 
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me 
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies 
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas 
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number 
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch.. 
Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga 
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands 
And said "Oh it's like that?" 
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit 
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit 
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number 
She asked could I give her mine two 
Got to the crib and called her up 
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck 
I said "Maxine check this out, 
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out" 
Got to the crib she let me in 
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom 
I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things" 
What the fuck are you doing? 
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing 
As she went for my midsection 
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt 
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work 
Before I hit it she said 
"3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass" 
I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok" 
She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS" 
I got up out 
Denaun: Hey, Maxine 
Maxine: What 
Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick? 
Maxine: Yeah for a small price 
Denaun: For a small price? What you mean? 
Maxine: You know, money nigga 
Denaun: You don't need no damn money, 
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit. 
Maxine: (laughing) What you, what you hear I got? 
Denaun: AIDS 
Maxine: (laughing) Who told you that bullshit? 
Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie 
Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then 
Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that? 
Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit, 
so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me, 
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga 
Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you 
Maxine: No, see.. 
Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you 
Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that 
Denaun: I want ya'll to get paid, fucking.. 
Maxine: (laughing as the phone hangs up)

[Eminem -verse 1] 
Jimmy can Crack Corn, but I don't care 
My enemies Crack Corn, but I don't care 
You can be black, white or albino, yeah 
You can have corn rows inside your hair 
I give a fuck if I don't like your stair 
This bottle of wine goes upside your head 
A little bit psycho, but I know that 
Think we just don't say it, then I won't say it 
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag 
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad 
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit 
You can just keep makin' them tired old threads 
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf, yeah 
See me, but don't dare to try no shit 
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers 
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass 
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast 
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go bad 
From outta nowhere, you might find your career 
Come to it,... and I was like (Oh Yeah) 
(Chorus) 
See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah) 
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah) 
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah) 
See Jimmy can Crack Corn but I don't care 
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)

And where the fuck we goin, well like (No where) 
[Eminem -verse 2] 
Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but 
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want 
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice 
If you keep comin' back, it only means you know you lost a fight 
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, cause they talk shit 
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squase it 
Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit 
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it 
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's a 'Go get 'em' 
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum?' 
We just keep winnin', by landslides oh en umm 
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' Denim 
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire 
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiyaa'' 
We ain't wire your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah 
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars 
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her 
Right in the ass with KY, Yes sir! 
So full of joy, why am I absurd 
Even Chingy would tell you 
'Yea boi don't curr' 
(Chorus) 
See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah) 
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah) 
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah) 
See Jimmy can Crack Corn but I don't care 
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah) 
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em) 
And where is G-Unit at, they're like (We over here) 
And where the fuck we goin, well like (No where) 
[50 Cent - verse 3] 
Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care 
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there 
It is what it is dawg, man life's not fair 
Ya friends shoulda know not to front 'round here 
You see kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear 
They'll strip yo ass, of your jewels, right here 
Man and I'ma say this one time, now get this clear 
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where 
A beautiful day, without drama is rare 
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share 
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare 
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up playa 
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor 
ridin', winding, dining and shining, know what I'm sayin 
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplayin' 
I'm making hits, my homies takin' hits, who's staying 
(Chorus) 
See us come to award shows we're like (Oh yeah) 
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah) 
See us keep blowin' up, we're like (Oh yeah) 
See Jimmy can Crack Corn but I don't care 
See me in your videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)

You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
"Murder Murder Redrum"
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related?"
Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (Ahhhh!) killed the bitch and did her
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didn't Ya?  Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
Chorus: Eminem + (Redman Sample) - 2X
[E] I'm low down and I'm shiftee!
"And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
 and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from.."
I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
Smoked out like Eckridge
Band just making my neck itch
What the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap hips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in
Chorus
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like "Ohh! This is good! Who sing this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit."
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin
Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for and IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
Chorus
In Love I just wanna hold my baby high above
I want this hand in its rightful glove
have people saying god damn shes fine
me responding with damn right shes mine
Even though your gone, I try and carry on
Its sad but its true, me and you
were through
but people still think they know us and they dont know shit
but i want you to know im sorry and i still love you britt
but now ive come to see, our destiny will never fit
and thats why now i look back being once lost then found
Its getting tougher with you not around
your the only thing that got me to smile
i guess our love was a truthful denile
sometimes i remenice at what we had
not knowin i was causing my baby to be sad
I never once tried to cause you this pain
its crazy how one person can make u go insane
Ill admit me and you we had our bad times
we fought, yea but people act like its a fuckin crime
no couples perfect, everyone faces bullshit
all i ever tried was to show you i loved you britt
but its sad cause the image i portray the pieces dont fit
All this time how could it be, my destiny will never be you and me
But i wish people could see, how much im so crazy
in love with you, its true i wish it was still me and you
doin what we use to do, i wish they really knew
and i wish theyd know id never let anything bad happend to you
i got your back to the fullest, baby nems one to stay truest
but times were tough, and shit got rough
every other day same shit breakin up and we fought
But just know britt my rhymes are true
Britt please know ill forever Love you
It just sucks cause theres a few out there that got Nems back
people always tellin me get your fuckin life on track
But in order to do that i need you back
and thats why you dont know what you got till its gone
Im so sorry that our love was always off and on....

What the fuck is wrong with you?
Ha
Hey, yo dawg, I got some shit on my motherfuckin' chest
That I need to get off 'cause if I don't, I'ma fuckin' explode or somethin'
Now look, this is a story about, some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this
It's so easy for me to make enemies any more it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin' their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that I don't wanna be in shit
I never had no beef with your corny son of a bitches
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm tellin' you right now motherfuck a Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin', see he chill
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin' cypherin name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin'
And I'da never involved you but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentionin' me
That little fuckin' weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin' 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared and Fred, you said you was dissin' him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy, up on stage
Screamin' how people hate you, they don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And how dare you motherfuckers that try to diss me back
That's a sissy act and don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song I'm tryin' to pre-warn you
Lethal when I fuckin' see you dawg, I'm swingin' on you
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw 'em up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all some girls, y'all are some goddamn girls
Why do you act this way? Why do you act this way, huh?
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know, we all know, hah
How fuckin' cowards roll, keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
In-fuckin'-dent me's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down
Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dogs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
In my coffin, I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no
(Nope)
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin' off me
I'm not bein' cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin' me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger
(Hey)
I say, "Fuck Christina", he says, "Fuck Christina" but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted
I'm peggin' Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up punk, you're dead, don't think that I'm playin'
And fuck Bizkit 'cause I know you're sayin' fuck D-12
Only not to our face, under your breath to yourselves
You little girls, motherfuckin' females
Why do you act this way? Why do y'all act this way huh?
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know, now we all know the truth
How fuckin' cowards roll "keep rollin', rollin', rollin"
In-fuckin-dent me's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down
Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in it
And that's it, that's all there is to it dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin' MTV talkin' about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin' ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin' song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now I ain't even on, no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin', you-up shit when I see you
And I will see you too, oh, and by the way Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards, haha
{eminem}		 123...7:00 party at my friends house	 dr.dre want me to
Sing new tunes and turn the place insideout I said...maby if mr.grady ill let
Me out of detenchion and ill talk my mom out susption while I'm cooking
Pancakes in the kitching at the same time making wishes hoping that they'll come
True cause it's the only thing to do and if they do come true my life	want be
So blue [chours]{dr.dre}when I say make some you say noise make some
(crowd)noise [dr.dre] make some{crowd{noise} [repeat3times]{eminem}every body
Make some noise ...now the party aready is jumping..people left the nextdoors
Neighbors party to come knocking on are door cause the music got more and more
Loud while I chowd sandwitches singing making more noise the party got so wild
The police came while I listing to the negihbor say 2can play at that game the
People at the party were so insane and when the police left I herd dr.dre say
{reapeat chours 7times and on 5th time fade}{dr.dre sings chours}
{Music reality
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we, as entertainers have a responsibility
To these kids, psyche}
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love or would it matter?
Could never be the lead off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate, I came way
Too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
"What the fuck, you take me for a joke? You smokin crack?"
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryin' to smack this one out the park, five thousand mark
Y'all steady tryin' to drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off, lid to the can of whip ass
Just twist me off, see me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin' I'm just tryin to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish leap
Yo slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life, when the music stops
Ain't no gettin' rid of McVeigh, if so you woulda tried
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch, is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemies' crib
With Hennessey, got drunk then I finished it
I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark diligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
To awake neighbors for acres
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Son of Sam bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin', you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops
I was happy havin' a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dog
And you ain't got nuttin' left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with their hands out, checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink, till your car spin you think
Damn, when you slam into the wall
And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow wonder would they even call?
When the music stops
Let's see, how many of your men loyal?
When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol, sippin' a can of Penz oil
I'm revved up, who said what, when lead bust
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddy wagon, braggin' about how you shouted
Like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggaz
If I was you niggaz, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can hurt me
Just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryin' to walk how G's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug of war with your life
Fuck a tour and a mike, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroner's like
You hype poppin' shit in broad daylight
Nigga, you're a goner at night when the music stops
Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like Woof!
Proof nigga I'ma wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe shit the more I moves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues, nigga
Or make the news, betcha all y'all move
When the Uzi pop you better drop, when the music stop
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the fifth grade
LL told me to, "Rock the Bells"
NWA said, "Fuck the Police," Now I'm in jail
Ninety three was strictly R and B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset smokin' crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimy and gritty
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock
I'm reachin' for the glock but the music stops
Hey, Dave, 'twas the night before Christmas we'll go!
Hi, boys, here I go!
'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
One, two, three, four, no, Dave, don't we wanna hear some more!
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had settled our heads for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there a rose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon outside was shining on the snow
When the look will right on the ground below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More faster than eagles the reindeer came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
"Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His cute little mouth was just like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
"Merry Christmas to all, and good-night."
[Intro]
So i changed, huh
You got a phone,
Pick it up, call me
[Chorus:]
How come, we don't even talk no more,
And you don't even call no more,
We don't barely keep in touch at all,
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,
After all the years we've been down,
Ain't no way, no how,
This bullshit can't be true,
We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you
[Verse One]
We were so young,
So full of life and vibrant,
Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went,
So close almost was some Bonnie and Clyde shit,
When Ronnie died you was right by my side,
With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,
You even had the same type of childhood I did,
Sometimes I just wanna know why,
Is it that you surcame to yours,
And mine I survived it,
You ran the streets I nine to fived it,
We grew up, grew apart this time went by us,
Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,
Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,
Much as your pride tries to hide it,
You're cold your touch, its like ice,
And your eyes is the look of resentment,
I can sense it and I don't like it
[Chorus]
(Kon Artis)
[Verse Two]
It was my dream at first to be on spittin the verse,
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse,
So I came out I would'a killed the nigger first,
'Fore I let him disrespect me,
Or check me up with somethin' worse,
Some bitch that I wasn't with,
I would hit her & quit,
but you would pull a talk with her 
&& tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her,
You were smoking the cron'c with her,
Coming out'a the bar with her,
Stumblin' half drunk,
Like y'all husband or wife or somthin',
But you cathin her fucken other niggaz
Must've hurt your pride or somthin',
'Cause you wolf I fit them after people,
Like you want it with me,
When all I tried to do is show you that your girl was shifty,
and ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced
You actin' like I ain't your man,
And lyin' like she can't be loose,
But I am really your friend,
I'm just trying to tell you the truth,
Don't hate the game or the playa',
The one that's changin is you
[Chorus]
(Proof)
[Verse Three]
We gettin lonely at the top
'cause my homie had to stop
now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
and homies in the hood only see me on the tube
so they gossip on the porch, get to speakin on who 
fools i used to rap with, all expect magic
like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it just happen
but Proof its just actin, at the party were stoned
shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home
see the devil in your grin, since the ghetto we been friends
forever, real intelligence, thats forever till the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lies
aint wastin my time with these snakes in disguise
(How come) when you talk its with bitter with fight
(And how come) its my fault for what you did with your life
and every time i go to hear you and play you look away
we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face
(Chorus)
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you
Can't you see what you do to me baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sack
We fuck like 2 jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
'Cuz the next day we're right back at it in the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us, we can't figure out if it's lust
Or it's love is what's attracting us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby
Because you stay with me, maybe, 'cuz you're as crazy as I am
'Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators
And dildos, you fuck yourself so much, you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24 but you're plenty more [Incomprehensible]
Sure than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like theyre in middle school, still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin'
You play your position, you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business, you've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind sometimes
They say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you
You are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter-fluid the fuel my fire
You're my entire supply gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs
To my table, if you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I am always gonna make you feel I don't need you
As much as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you are essential to me, you are the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me, I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you are the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Haillie
You are the word that I am looking for when I'm trying to describe
How I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You are like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you
Before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much too much is never enough
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love
I go crazy on you, crazy on you
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you
[Chorus]
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
and it seems like yesterday it was just a dream 
but those days are gone they're just memories
and it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
but those days are gone
[EMINEM]
Alright,
lets pretend, marshall mathers never picked up a pen
lets pretend, things woulda been no different
pretend he procrastinated and had no motivation
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
they could blow away with the wind
marshall youre never gonna make it
makes no sense to play the game
there aint no way that you'll win
pretend he'd just stay outside all day
and play with his friends
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
and it wasnt time to move and schools werent changing again
he wasnt socially akward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
and just lazy as shit
fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
you wont amount to shit, quit day dreaming, kid
you need to get your cranium checked
you're thinking like an alien, it just aint realistic
now pretend things [???] angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed 
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didnt make it to the rap olympics
left to his plane and he missed it
he's gonna have a hard time explaining to hailey and lainey
these food stamps and this weak shit 
cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
but it didnt fall on his lap so he aint even here
he pretends that ..
[Chorus]
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Em, it's Paul, listen
Joel just called me and he told me
You're in the fucking back behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around like an idiot
Outside of your home, you're gonna get yourself in trouble
Don't bring your gun outside of your home, you can't carry it on you
Leave your fucking gun at home
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for like Philly
I feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely
I apologize if all that I sound like, is I'm complaining
But life keeps on complicating and I'm debating
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls
Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help
I can't do it by myself
Too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying
Around with the idea of ending the shit right here
I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her, shit
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened at you? Can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills
And your own fans are laughin' at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, nobody, he fights first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm poppin Vic's, perks and Methadone pills
Yeah 'em, tight verse, you killed it
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes man
And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
  (Don't know what I'm going through)
(But I just keep on going through changes)
My friends just can't understand this new me
That's understandable man but just think how bananas
You'd be, you'd be an animal too, if you were trapped
In this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watchin' the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah, homie, come on, don't look now
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah, baby, hold me down
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
  (Don't know what I'm going through)
(But I just keep on going through changes)
Wake up in the hospital
Full of tubes, plus somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few
Facts 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint
I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why
I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
  (Don't know what I'm going through)
(But I just keep on going through changes)
[Intro]
Look....if you had...one shot....one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted...in one moment
Would you capture it?...Or just let it slip? Yo..
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweety, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how? Everybody's choking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over BLOAH !
Snap back to reality, ohh, there goes gravity
Ohh there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo this whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Chorus]
You better, lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo...
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo...
[Verse 2]
My soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder 
It only grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on, dah dah dum, dah dum dum
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin',and step writing the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
fact that I can't get by with my nine to 
five and I can't provide the right type of
life for my family, 'cause man these Goddamn food stamps
Don't buy diapers, and it's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed plus, teetertotter
Caught up between being a father and a pre maddonna
Baby momma drama screamin' and it's too much for me, 
To wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotamy
Has gotten me, to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot, before I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom I love you but this trailer has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not cos
This may be the only opportunity that I got
[Chorus]
[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to man
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors, Andre's phantom believe me clowns
That means suicide, homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world when you're the only
One with the balls and your shorts
To leave them jaws on the floor with no remorse
Remember that when they get to doggin' your boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about Bologna
I'm not gonna stop the saga
Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi, I'm moppin the floors
With them, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be, long 'til this sport is O V
E R, just blazin' and we are knockin' them doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S N double O P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yes, it's the best thing I could do right now Doodi for you is to rap
So I'mma fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'mma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate
I'mma need two mics
'Cuz the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong
I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyming bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water slaughter 'em homes
I'm on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same with you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, nah, Doodi you're not layin' on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doodi
The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie, I'll never forget you, no
You think you know me, please
You have no idea
you think my life is great, shit
I cover up the tears
but inside my scalp, it starts
a burn in hell
Thoughts of hurtin myself and homicide is real
But you cant tell cause im good at hiding myself
I've got a lot of problems
That I've never shared with no one else
I've been to a lot of doctors
But the shit never helps
They just stuff me with the pills for all the pain that I felt
And as we press the gression got me naked in depression
Got me playin Russian Roulette with this smith and wesson
Remeniscing back when things were still glistenin'
when things was still playin with a puzzle and pieces werent missin
Those days, I miss them
But those days, I kiss them
Goodbye for good
Those days are the old days
Now lets pay the rent before you end up on the wrong day
And I'm tired of being broke
I'm ready to shake you up
Give me all your money bitch and that chain you've got tucked
I see you flaunting all that ice
You must be ballin' but I don't got shit so hang me your wallet (fades)
Comin up it never mattered what color you was, if you could spit then you could spit, that's it, that's what it was. Back when motherfuckers was straight back packin' syphron fightin' for life in this rap for the mic to get passed, and you phsyiced and your gassin, and you hyped cause you lastin, and you might win some massive, if you lost then you lost, shake hands like a man and you swallowed it. Went on some hype column in the source was like my only source of light when the mics use to mean something, the four was like you was the shit, now it's like the least you get 3 and a half now which means yous a peice of shit, for and a half or five means you Biggie Jigga Naz, or Benzino. See I don't even think you realize you playin with motherfuckers lives. I don't watch Greg get fucked on the chronic probably cause i was on it. Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide, I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin breathe to get a five, shit I was right I'ld a fuckin died already tryin' I swear to God, I never lied. Tell us why you and that bitch gave me that bullshit review, I sat and took it, and look at the shit we knew, you try to fuck us with obby in 52. hhhkkkk pewww, fuck a relationship we through, no more source with street credit them days is dead, Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays' head.. Every issue there's an 8 page makemen spread. Will someone please tell him whoever braids his head I am not afraid of this fuckin wastin lead on my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple. So listen closely, cause I break it down and proceed, this oj's 'bout to get smoked like row weed. You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother you motherfuckin' punk. Put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell you little sell out mag., I ain't mad I feel bad, here's an ad here's a poster of Ray Ray and his dad. You want to talk about some shit you don't know about, yeah, let's talk about how your puttin' your own son out there to try to eat off him, cause you missed your boat, cause your never gunna blow bitch, your just too old. No wonder your sore now, lordy your bored now, I'm pushin' 30 your kick 40's door down. Business is war and you'll never beat me, all you do is cheat me, out of cordables, but you know you'll always see me, on your little tv, cause you got to stay up to 3 in the mornin' to see your video played once on B.E.T. So, hehe he, who has the last laugh after mad gas, you won't be half of a whole stack. Kiss her asshole cracks, you'll never fold or whole back, just know that. Benzy knows whack, no matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow jack. Your better off tryin to bring R and Soul back, look at your track record, thats how far it goes back.. It's extortion and rounds of portion, so half of the staff affair fresh out of jail from Boston. Bullyin' and bossin', gave like a slave, they completely brain washed him, and forced him to stay locked in his own office. Afraid of the softest vaguest wanna be gangsta in New York. And it's pitiful cause I would of never said shit if you'd kept your mouth shut bitch now what. Here da clue, spit it Slain, new shit, exclusive your landin and yo who get, you know what to do with this use it, I'm through witdis, this is stupid, I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this, and who you callin a bitch...bitch. You owe me.

Your homie on the block can get it too 
Ya'll little motherfuckers ain't gangster 
Save your crew 
Before I put a hit out on you 
Before I let my niggers come threw 
Ya'll little motherfuckers ain't gangster, gangster 
Oeh
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late
(I can't keep chasing 'em)
(Taking my life away)
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right, I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life
I would've laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain, bitch, you took me for granted
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you, while I stayed
Thankful all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase, it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left, I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now? Yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but it's
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
'Til I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
I cannot moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still, man, I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers, I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you, oh, now I'm special
How I felt special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this, helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch, chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn in, so I guess, I'ma mess, cursed and blessed
But this time I'ma ain't changing my mind, I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip hop, I'm leaving you
My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a change, 25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Yeah, it's 50 A.K.A. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it
You said you a gansta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I'm a run up on you with tha nine
We do this all tha time, right now we on tha grind
So hurry up and cop and go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like dat gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every nine
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cuz I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
Damn homie, in highskew you was tha man, homie
What the fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest phonetta, when it come to the chedda
Nigga, if you play with my paper, you gotta meet my berretta
Now shorty think I'm a sweat her, sippin' on Amoretta
I'm livin' once then deada, I know I can do betta
She look good, but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, she get your whole crew wet
We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step
Gorilla Unit 'cuz they say we bugged out
'Cuz we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' in a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
Me I'm no mobsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no acta
But it's me you see on your TV
'Cuz I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they goin' murd' 50, how?
We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil' Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin' a long time
And you ain't got nuttin'
Damn homie

(Eminem - 4X)
I'll shit on you
Da da da da
I'll shit on you
I will shit
I'll shit on you
Girl you know
I'll shit on you
Bitch or man
I'll shit on you
I will shit
(Swift aka Swifty McVeigh)
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin bombs to the back of record companies
Blow em up if they ain't want me
The national guard
They scared to hunt me
I love beef
I got you hoes duckin' me
A drug thief
Bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep yo ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred-degree saunas
You can act a fool if you wanna (bitch)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped with a grenade
In the pool with your mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin up like a condom
Slap it if you muthafuckas got a problem
When I see 'em
You hoes endin' up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hiden in the trunk of a black & gold BMW
Pull in the garage while u screamin'
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin'
I'll shit on you
(Chorus)
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
Fuck your house
Fuck your jewelry
And fuck your watch
Fuck your wife
Fuck your kids
Fuck your family
I'll shit on you
(Bizarre aka Peter S. Bizarre)
I'm a alcoholic with the fuckin' toilet
Pass the hot dogs
(bizarre aren't you Islamic)
Bitch shut your fuckin mouth
I'ma keep eatin till
Richard Simmons comes to my house with a chain saw to cut me out
I'll fuck your wife
I had sex since I met her
I'm to busy fuckin
Your 12 year old baby-sitter
And all women ain't shit
Only good for cookin, cleanin, and suckin dick and thats it
I was responsible for killin' John Candy
I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my 98 camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody
Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre
(Eminem aka Slim Shady)
My adolescent years weren't shit to what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown and grew down
The older I get the dumber the shit I get in
The more ignorant the incident is I fit in
Ignorin the shit how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who raised me and say the can take me
Its they who's legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
"I'll shit on you"
I'll spit on you
Start pissin' then do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin I said I'll cop a squat on you and
Start spillin my guts like chicken cordon bleu
And straight shit
Like notorious big did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants down
(Chorus)
(Kon Artis aka Denine Porter)
Is Richard Pryor still alive
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin'
Born brainless
This steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang it
Bitch brang it
These niggas that i hang wit
Will hang u up naked by your ankles danglin
My needa stays stranglin
I don't need your help
If u gon give me the pussy
I'll unloosen my belt
I'll punch your daddy not
Your moms kinda cock
Your sister tends court
Your aunt supply her rocks
Buck 50 cross yo neck
Floss yo tek
I'll beat you wit it across yo chest
(Kuniva aka Von)
It's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat your peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the police man
Who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
I see hoes bitin
Y'all don't wanna brawl
Thats like D-bo fightin Peablo Bryson
So what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth
And pull your fuckin skeleton out
Niggas get hit wit a two piece
"Bling Bling"
With a poisonous sting
I'm such a violent thing
(Chorus)
(Eminem aka Slim Shady)
Once I get on 2 hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts 5 more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack
In black jackets who pack 10
9 millimetres
5 criminals pullin heaters
And spillin liters of blood like swimmin pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too
A lotta people say misoginistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it and start up a damn riot
If u don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy girl dog woman man child
I'll shit on you
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you
Fuck your house fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you
I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me
I'll shit on you
You heard me
(Eminem laughing)
Bitch
I'll shit on you
D-12 will shit on you
I'll shit on you
Your life
Your wife
Your kids
Your car
I'll shit on you
Your house
Your spouse
Your rings
Your things
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and I give you the news
With a twist, it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade; you been afraid, I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toasters and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies, niggaz crotched over
Mommy's knocked up, 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown, when Child Support knocked
No, he's not around now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you lose your tie and your shirt
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict like you didn't experiment?
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I don't think you do, so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause here we go he's jigga joint jigga chk jigga
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss My Ass
It's just a renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to talk
About anything, anything, anything, anything
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at, any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to holler
About anything, anything, anything, anything
I had to hustle my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Doo-rag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefter often
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown, 'specially on nights
I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these latter day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See, it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin' Dixie
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons
Take a bath with the Catholics in holy water
No wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful, eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers
'Cause I'm a muh'fuckin' renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to talk about
Anything, anything, anything, anything
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to holler about
Anything, anything, anything, anything
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to talk about
Anything, anything, anything, anything
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to holler about
Anything, anything, anything, anything
Whoo, hey, how you guys doin'?
You want more?
Alright, then shut up
Shoo bee doo
  (Shoo bee doo)
Shoo bee doo
  (Shoo bee doo)
Shoo bee doo
  (Shoo bee doo)
Shoo bee doo
Shoo bee, snoo be dee bee bop
Girl
(Girl, girl, girl)
You're my world
(World, world world)
You're my girl
(Girl, girl girl)
You're my world
(World, world, world)
Here's a song for da ladies
station>
Proof (From D12):
Yeah soul intent, checking it number 1 baby this week,
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is M.C. Proof
Hare:
And D.J. Hare.
Proof (From D12):
Checkin' in on W.E.G.O.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ay yo we got the number 1 requested song, of the DAY coming up next.
It's a local thing wants retilin'
It goes by the name of Eminem
And it's called "It's OK"
Artist: bad meets evil (eminem and royce the 5-9)
[royce]	what?  uhh..
[em] the bad..
[royce] yeah..
[em]	the evil..
[royce] right, yo
[em]	put em together
Chorus: royce the 5-9, eminem
[royce] yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin to strip
[em] if it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothin to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothin to chew
[royce] yo..
[both]	i'm just fuckin with you, cause I got nothin to do
[eminem]
I am bored!!!!!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers *crash sound*
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin your wallet off
And slippin a molotov in your cocktail (take that)
Burnin your contracts, punch your a&r in the face *punch sound*
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missin I took it (whoops!)
Nurse look at this straightjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (fedex)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head
When the rest of his body's still alive runnin? 
[royce]
Comin with five gunmen, waitin to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what? ) hide from it
For every hundred mc's rhymin about birds
Only about two-thirds'd really set it without words
Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's rainin slugs (what? )
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The bad and evil mad rap, I cover the bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what? )
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible
Chorus: 2x
[eminem]
*yawns* forget a chorus -- my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause (yay)
And by the time you all catch on, i'ma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin to fall back on!
I'll throw you off of ten floors .. *ahhhhhhh*
Pull a fuckin headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
I'm indoors, waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, "it oughta happen.
You swallow cum bitch? "  "no, but I brought a napkin"
Gettin skullie while I'm autographin
Got my daughter laughin cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin
I'm not a fact, i'ma proven fear
Mr. rogers blocked up my u-haul screamin,
"wait, wait, wait.. you ain't movin here!"
Lorena bobbitt, c'mere, want a souveneir? 
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile?  same difference -- I need some 'caine
Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(oh my god!) brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'
[royce]
Walkin in swamp water with an m-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (what? )
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin my fame, blowin your hand off
Dancin with the devil leadin - I won't die, I'm never leavin (what? )
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin
Street niggaz with nuts, what?  my meat's bigger (what? )
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinkin I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what? )
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for
Chorus 2x
[em]	the bad.. the evil..
The bad.. the evil..
Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger
Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds still we take to the street
For the kill, with the skill to survive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger
Risin' up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin' like Boone's Farm
Hidin' under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own moms
Connivin' Kon, Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screamin', "Let's get it on"
A lush that love to drink, drunk drivin' a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slittin' your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music
You know why my hands are so numb? No
'Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't come, oh
Smacked this whore for talkin' crap, bitch
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
I fuckin' hate you, I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you, hell yeah
Satan done got me on this song
Eatin' a hot dog readin' the Holy Quran while I'm on the John
Tired of wearin' this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs, thong, thong, thong
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms, fuck your love songs
This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on?
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-16's and one pump, click-clack
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaw
Have you runnin' out this fuckin' club in your drawers
We lovin' the broads, there's nothin' to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in The Source, it's fight music
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the priest sayin', "You hear that?"
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin', came back and fucked up
His pallbearers and made 'em drop his coffin, it's fight music
These beads I'm swingin' is stingin' 'em
See all these niggaz? When I step in the club, I'm bringin' 'em
If any nigga lookin' too hard, we Rodney King 'n 'em
Malice green to them and gasolinin' 'em with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right hookin', right when your wife's lookin'
Fuck fight music, bitch this is losin' your life music
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberace's, Versace's and you Nazis
Watch me 'cause you thinkin' you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed as you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise 'em 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to and it's called
This kind of music, use it and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid, it's fight music
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe 'til I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work
For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
'Cuz we are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see either of us
Coming to terms where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reason speakin' wit me
You speak on my seed then me, no speakin' Englais
So we gonna beef and keep on beefin' unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangsta pee on himself
I see you D-12 and thanks but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all you, Ja, you'll get it too!
So go to sleep bitch!
Die, mothafucka, die! Time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
(Unh)
Go to sleep, bitch!
(What?)
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch!
(What?)
Die mothafucka die, motherfucker
(Bi bi, bi bi)!
Go to sleep bitch!
(What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why die, die mothafucka, ah, ah, ah, go to sleep bitch!
We got you niggaz, nervous
On purpose to hurt your focus, you'se not MC's, you'se worthless
You'se not them G's, you'se a circus, you'se no appeal, please
You'se curtains, you use words, cool heard
Slurred in two thousand third
You'se purpin', you'se no threat, who's ya servin'?
We lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You'se not the streets, you'se the deaths
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth
So go to sleep bitch!
Die, mothafucka, die! Time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
(Unh)
Go to sleep, bitch!
(What?)
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch!
(What?)
Die mothafucka die, motherfucker
(Bi bi, bi bi)!
Go to sleep bitch!
(What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why die, die mothafucka, ah, ah, ah, go to sleep bitch!
Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin' New York wit the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sweet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin'
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy-going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get when dog gone bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ and my Blood Line is tight
'Cuz it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line, and, we can go track for track
Damn dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?
So go to sleep bitch!
Die, mothafucka, die! Time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
(Unh)
Go to sleep, bitch!
(What?)
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch!
(What?)
Die mothafucka die, motherfucker
(Bi bi, bi bi)!
Go to sleep bitch!
(What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why die, die mothafucka, ah, ah, ah, go to sleep bitch!
All you motherfuckers! Take that!
Here, take this too, bitch! Uh, uh, uh, uh, waaahoo!
We're killin' all you motherfuckers dead, all you!
Fake ass gangsters! No more press! No more press!
Rot, motherfuckers, rot!
Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfucking dirt!
(Unhn)
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless! No more fame!
Ahh! Hahahaha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, haha
Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless
I absolutely have to I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie`s name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV yeah I'm talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it I understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated 'cuz once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Mean while my attention is pullin' in another direction
Some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't try na have none of my people hurt and murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws well then I can 'cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cuz
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
Yeah!
God damn
Feels like a long time don't it
You missed up
We missed you
Shady narcotics
It's the re-up
Pussies
And we're back
Myself
D-12
50 cent
Obie Trice
Stat Quo
And I would also like to introduce
The two newest members of the family
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek
The other goes by the name of Cashis
From Orange county
And I think it's about time we cut the bullshit
Let's go
Hey em its paul (pause) ummm
Liseten i just got a call from the label(pause)and you probably not going to be surprised but uh.. michael jackson is extremely upset about the just lose it video. and um i mean he's pissed so i-i dont know what hes gonna do but we gotta talk about how were gonna handle this .. oh yeah anyway somebody told me that they heard a rumor that you got a new gun umm i know its probably not true but i just need to talk to you about that.. soo uhh gimme a call (click)
Yeah, ya know? Critics man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know the one thing I notice about critics, man?
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'mma tell 'em
Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the 'dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter, hot headed as ghost rider
Cold hearted as spiderman throwin' a spider in the snow
So ya better get to blowin in flow rider
Inside of a low rider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't gob this is a blister in the salt
Those are your wounds this is the salt, so get lost
Shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze, beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his draws
Ticklin' him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog
You're on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
Your on fire
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick, I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
You're on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire
I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses
If you mistook the for a song, look
This ain't a song it's a warnin' to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, your a fuckin' flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan
Mr Mathers is the man
Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy
And stash it in a can, come back and whip your ass with it again
Salivas like sulfuric acid in your hand it'll eat through
Anything metal the ass of iron man
Turn him into plastic so for you to think
That you could stand a fuckin' chance is assanine
Yeah, ask the nine man, hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon
Fuck it I ain't playin', pull up in a van and hop out
At a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage you ain't never seen the brew
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a belemic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut boo
Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick don't nobody care
Then why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
Nobody will fuckin' test me 'cause these hos won't even dare
I'm wastin' punchlines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw, don't waste it save it, psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair
You're on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so hot my motherfuckin' firetrucks on fire, homie
You're on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
You're on fire, yeah, your on fire
You're on fire
By nas
Uh, ohhhhh, baby, baby (uh ha ha ha ha)
Keep it thug and keep your heat
Na na na na
Verse 1
Now slowly, thinkin of all the things that appose me,
I think of kings who died and rappers out to de-throne me, (uh)
Before they crowned there head is cut off,
Bodies is layin dead in the street it's so fuckin pitiful,
First they love me, could be the bitch that even live with you,
Mad at your riches now she switch turn miserable, (uh)
Cause she want to dress like bonnie, robbie and christal do,
But christal single, bonnie's broke and a nigga's too,
I can do bad by myself, went from rags to wealth,
From jagz to bently's to plenty ass bitchs,
Cant keep their hands to there self nomore,
I'm like hue hefner, you lessar, you just...
Chorus
Wanna be me, you cant, you faggot, you bitch,
You social coward, you clown, you just wanna be down,
So you wanna be me, you bitch, you phony, you clone me,
You wanna be me son, I'm the one and only, but you,
Wanna be me, you suckers, you weak, you flunky's,
You fake, you could'nt come close on my worst day,
But you wanna be me, I'll burn you and learn you a lesson,
Consernin is my profession, turnin ya my direction,
You cant be me
Verse 2
No even in your wildest fantasy,
Its childish, shit I haft ta resort to violance,
Pay me ahalf a million, I'll consult your album,
And show you how to stay off my dick,
Thats the thing I hate the most, cant even call you a man,
When you gotta call out my name to get ya some fans,
No tallent, you need direction, your a pussy with a yeast infection,
You unlucky, I'm your fuckin c section,
Plus I'm the last real nigga alive,
Toast glass l with-o the label, get high,
Rely, how many classics I gave you,
Perhaps if you think back, you'll relize that I made you...
Chorus
Verse 3
I'm tryin to walk a straight line,
While they tryin to take mine,
I'm pass 8 miles of every state line,
Eating alegators and humming bird hearts,
At the player ball preani suit, shupers watch (? ? ),
As real million-airs shittas take place (? ? ),
Evil is hitlers hate race, people this is god's son,
And I've come from the garden of pure peace,
To represent the streets, you will see,
That my plan is not to destroy a man,
But to bring more to mankind and teach,
Every mc reach for your pens and papers,
Lesson 1 be creative, what you made of junior,
Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in ya hand,
And understand to battle nas is not in ya plan,
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that,
And you my offspring, a boss-sting(? ? ),
A bullet proof, posche things, hard for you to understand that,
Nas the king, where my cribs (? ? ), where my benz at,
Play me a gangsta's theme, while you entertain me,
If I ain't cryin, laughin to the lines, throw your ass in,
What the fuck were you nigga's thinkin,
Guns would clutch if I get an anklin
That you commin for the kingpin,
But I laugh at you cowards, ha, ha, ha,
Take me out, try, try, try....
Chorus
Justin? It's Zoe
Um, Kelly did not have me call, however
I just listened to Eminem in her car and
It is the most disgusting thing
I have ever heard in my entire life
And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent
And tell him how fucking disgusting he is
It, like, makes me upset and
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch
Goodbye
Remember me?
(Seven executions)
Remember me?
(I have no remorse)
Remember me?
(I'm 'High Powered')
Remember me?
  (I drop bombs like Hiroshima)
For this one it's the X, you retarded?
'Cause I grab the mic and get down, like Syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses, without boundaries
Which qualifies me for the term 'Universal'
Without no rehearsal, I leak words that's controvers'al
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I'll hit yo' ass like the train did that bitch
That got "Banned From TV"
Heavyweight hitter
Hit you, watch your whole head split up
Loco-is-the-motion, we comin' th'ough
Hollow tips is the lead the .45 threw
Remember me?
(Throw ya gunz in the air)
Remember me?
(Slam, slam)
Remember me?
(Nigga 'Bacdafucup')
Remember me?
 (Chka-chka-Onyx)
Niggaz that take no for an answer, get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like, "No, no, no!"
Life a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead-a the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta one metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence? Nope, never leave a shred-of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My moms got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? You better dead that shit
My name should be "Can't believe that Nngga said dat shit"
Probably sayin', "He ain't a killer", but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I'm-a do to you, have done to you
Got niggaz in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do, cocksuckers? We glock-busters
'Til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin' wires, niggaz wantin' me dead, wantin' my head
You think it could be somethin' I said?
Remember me?
(I just don't give a fuck)
Remember me?
(Yeah, fuck you too!)
Remember me?
(I'm low down and I'm shifty)
Remember me?
(I'm Shady)
When I go out, I'm-a go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to da club, stupid
I'm tryin' to clear up my fuckin' image, so I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say, "Fuckin'" for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen
With M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?
Fuck that, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And re-appear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
What the fuck you starin' at, nigga?
Don't you remember me?
Remember me?
Remember me?
Remember me?

Scandalous partners, whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with, content, yo who wanna start with
Experts, bad and evil is comin soon

Leavin all of you cats shittin kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggaz be cockin pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin the profits with you (what? )
Six percent, of y'all niggaz is just pretend
Clicks with clits, pussy niggaz stick with dicks (what? )
Niggaz act bully, and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggaz packin semi
Speak darts; yo you get paid?  rhymin about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
Five nine, a street nigga with deep feelin (what? )
I keep illin, my steez willin to keep killin (what? )
Fuck rap, a lot of y'all all is just acts

Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And i'ma spit thunder (what? ) stick to my guns
Niggaz is finished before they gimmicks, one-hit wonders
What?  big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls

Split y'all, holla, "it's on!"  then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggaz get pissed on claimin you pissed off
Chorus: eminem and royce (repeat 2x)
Y'all want drama?  wanna make a scary movie? 
Rappers comin in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin, directin and starrin in it
[eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the grand canyon
Hop out of a grand am and land in it handstandin
Any man plannin to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin
I'm headed for hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill clinton, hit this, and you better inhale
Cause any mc that chooses to go against me
Is gettin takin advantage of like monica lewinksy (leave me alone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushin a ten speed
Screamin to aunt peg (aunt peg!!!!)
With three spokes stickin out of my pant leg
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine
Damnit I like pain (ahh!)
And you should be anywhere that I might gain
You rap knowin you wack
You act up and I'm throwin you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwin you back up em
If they don't like the track, fuck em
The rap struck em harder then gettin hit by a mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second celebrity deathmatch (ding! ding!)
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly (hurry up man!)
I'm sicker than a tupac dedication to biggie
I'm free-fallin feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest till you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the empire state building and get to the last step
And still have half left
Chorus
[em]	bad.. the bad..
[r5]	uhh, when the bad meets the bad.. yo..
[em]	the evil
[r5]	take the evil with the evil
[em] put em together

It's murda, ha ha ha
It's murda, we back up in this muthafucka
It's murda
Y'all know who we be
  (Aiyyo don't let me catch ya runnin' from the back of BET either nigga)
My nigga Fatal on tha muthafuckin' ones and twos
Holla back you bitch ass niggaz
Yo, cocksucka', I get squat and post and cocked tha nina'
In tha five series Beamer, dump and lean ya
I fell off on a misdemeanor, ride red over black madina's
Take crazy for genius
Hated like Jesus Christ
My weakness always been bad bitches and new bills with creases
My thesis more than extraordinary
And that nigga that got shot nine times
Can tell ya that I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
God may I ask yo' permission to take his life
This is your man be I N C to R U L E extraordinary, one for tha ages
When done sawed off with tha front of them gauges
To engage in combat, to send you and fem where yo mom's at
Motherfucka you hear that?
And I ain't talkin' about them heavenly skies
I'm talkin' fire from nines
Or maybe the fifty cal 'cause you like five-oh
Or maybe somewhere in Cal where you like to lay low
You bitch made, and I heard about that bitch

A.I ain't in tha click, believe they won't win without me
Yo, I'm small lil' homies, frail but bold

Keep tha heat in tha winter I can't tell it's cold
Clean my set, pieced out flame tha tec
Throw shots niggas catch like Wayne Cherbet
Son of a gangsta, talk dirty son I'm a bang ya
I'm tha truth with tha ox, keep gum on tha banger
Hussein, the only reason hoes chase tha thugs
Nigga Blade Part Two I got tha taste for blood
Log on Fatal.com, see fatal drop bombs
More militant minded then y'all faded with 'Pac rhymes
Clutching tha stick beam, suckin' tha stick green
Out tha window or tha sunroof, buckin' tha sixteen
You ain't a gangsta 'em, this is gangsta shit
And 50 you ain't nuthin' but a gangsta bitch
Pac' would have never did no song with no wanksta snitch
He confusin' y'all he ain't tha shit
We sex, money and murda you niggas
Ain't no playin' around with this rap shit
Banana clip, mack's spit bodies wrapped in plastic

M.I.B. nigga, Murder Inc bosses
Rule we here baby, Brick City Jerseys
Yeah, Shadow let's get it
Uncle Marshall!
Will you tell us a bedtime story?
Here we go...
Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!
[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch
Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 
[Chorus]
So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" [WOOSH!]
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
[BOOSH!] (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice [BOOSH! BOOSH!]
[BOOSH! BOOSH!] (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 
[Chorus]
So let's get down to business, 
I don't got no time to play around
What is this, what is this
The invasion
Green lantern
The infiltration
We comin
I got 50 Cent,
I got G-UNIT,
D twizzy in this bitch, wit Obie Trice
So watch what you say,
'fore you call our name
'cause you say one more thing,
and it won't be nice
Here we go I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
are too jealous of us to love us
you hate it
G-UNIT made it
And Obies comin, D twizzis comin,
ya sick to ya stomach
50 percent of it is 50 Cent
the other 50 percent of it's whose color of skin it is
but if you even considerin
Takin our label down
you better find our building
and fly a fuckin plane into it
But I ain't tryin to get to intriquite into it
i'm just tryin to give you a little hint for ya own benefit
'cause then it's just gonna get to the point
where it escalates into some otha shit
then imma flip 
them imma get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Wont be able to tell if it's 2 pairs or it's one
'cause it's gonna feel like so many feet kickin you
You'll think nike just made these innercleet tennis shoe
i dont know what it is or what it could be
but i get a woody when these pussies try to push me 
thinkin they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
yall tickle me pink ,I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
hickory dickory dock tickity tock tickity
a little bit of da diggidy dock diggidy
mixed wit a lil bit of the jigga ji jigga
wit a small pinch of biggie look at me im just the bomb diggity
(CHORUS):

HAHA --- WOO

Still Aftermath
and dont think we dont hear you mothafuckas talkin
'cause we do, we see yall
but we just gon sit back for a minute and watch what the fuck yall do
[Eminem]
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just, put it all into all I spit
Instead of always tryin to swallow it
Instead of starin at this wall and shit
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it, shit
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
if I have to see another one of mom's alcholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin with another fuckin politic
I'm like a skillet bubblin until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up
Blow this buildin up, I've been sealed enough
My cup, runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts?
Well I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peal the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps yea, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
what you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
You need piece of mind?  Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
to express how I'm really feelin at that time
Yea sometimes sometimes sometimes
Just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
{*rip*} I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in this slump, can't think of nothin
Fuck I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin
{*crumples paper*} Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
fuckin boilin point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chainlink fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin someone
By the way they're runnin, you would swear the law was comin
It's now or never and tonight is all or nothin
Momma Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch
I found my nitch, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I had half a chance I'd grab it - Rabbit, run
Hi
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling with a capital
Somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple
(Hurry up)
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said, "I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feelin' these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
(Yuck, yuck)
Hit you in the head with a brick til' you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til' you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dyin' in my sleep, I don't feel it
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy, hello, hi
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, do you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy
I'm ice grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
Than a maniac, Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese, with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins, it probably all depends
On if I keep on killin' my girlfriends
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy, listen
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy, you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks)
I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, 'cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til' I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS", forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes usin' dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme
I couldn't read it, damn
[Intro Obie Trice]
You dont see me in the hood
its because im doin this man
[Obie Trice]
Niggas im still grindin
im still hearin those sirens
im still gettin chased by those lights
only the lights lime, and my mics on
and my time is none, because im writing more
and i aint here to meet a soul in this business
im here to eat, speak until these ho's feel this
and i cant let ya'll derail me man
i got young coby homie, you gotta let go of obie
because obie be back(i dont know man)
we got them craps goin on, and that yack goin on
soon as a nigga touch down, back from tourin
its whatever, put that on the cheddar man
but in the mean time, its jimmy iovine time
chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out
this is it my niggaz, this what we boast about
now im here, so shut your mother fuckin mouth
and show me love bitch
Chorus X2
I just wanna love ya
for the rest of my life(i dont love you bitch)
i wanna hold you in the morn'
hold you through the night
[Eminem]
Theres a certain mystique, when i speak
that you notice that sort of unique
cause you know its me, my poetry's deep
and im stillmatic the way i flow to this beat
you cant sit still
its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
im strapped, just knowin any minute, i could snap
im the equivelent if what would happen if bush rapped
i bully these rappers so bad, lyrically
it aint even funny, i aint even hungry
it aint even money, you cant pay me enough
for you to play me, its cacamamy
you just aint zaney enough, to rock with shady
my noodle is cockadoodle, my clock is cookoo
i got screws loose, yeh the whole kit n caboodle
im just brutal, its not rumour, im numeral uno
assume it, theres no humour in it, no more you know
im rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
you better love me, bitch
Chorus X2
(and all the bitches say)
[50 Cent]
My boys is crazy in the hood,
they holler my name
if it aint about the flow its bout the stones and the chain(yea)
if i was you, i'd love me too, i roll like a boss
911 porsche, same color as cranberry sauce
i aint goin front, i thought r kelly was the shit
let me find out, he fucked around with bow wow bitch
niggaz eatin popcorn, right rewinding and the tape
now shorty momma in the precinct, hollerin rape
im convinced man, something really wrong with these hos
i thought lil kim was hot till she started fuckin with her nose(got damn)
i used to listen to lauren hill, and tap my feet
then the bitch put out a cd that didnt have no beat
that boy d'angelo, hes determined not to fail
that nigga went buttass for his record to sell
my back shots are help ashanti hit them high notes
and big ben taught charlie b moore to deep throat
Chorus X2
[Tupac Shakur]
Get on your knees nigga
Get on your knees and pray, haha
(*scratching*)
[Ja Rule from +Loose Change+]
Em you claim your mother's a crackhead and Kim is a known slut
So what's Hailie gonna be when she grows up
[Intro - Eminem - talking] + (Hailie) (*echo*)
A ha
Yeah
C'mon, G-G-G-G-UNIT!
Hailie (what?)
Come here baby
Bring daddy his Oscar (okay)
Where gonna shove up Ja Rule's ass (*laughing*)
[Verse 1 - Swifty McVay]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to Murder Inc. with lead and I ain't talkin about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claimin you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put "E" before the "D" because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch), you a replica guy (*gunshots fired*)
If he was still alive, you would never get by (for real)
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real
Life is more than imitatin niggaz and eatin pills
And what kinda motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin, you a brother gettin cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin on his color cause he need it
(2Pac: Get on your knees and pray)
And all you niggaz hatin, shut your mouths
It's just the real niggaz ain't buyin that shit y'all put out
[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]
Doe Rae Me, but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murder Inc. do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin less than R & B comin from that regime
Regime, is a little extreme
That connect some soldiers, motherfuckin Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave our witness team on the TV screen
Chased the greed, now that you embraced the green
Don't fuck with them triple beams
You's a motherfuckin actor slash Pac impersonatin rapper
Slash Billy Holiday, how it happen?
Artists and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed 'em
Told 'em reenact 'em, you go platinum
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy
Jeffrey Atkins reenactin her boy
So I'm click clackin the toy, mash and destroy (*gun cocked and fired*)
Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker (*gunshots*)
[Chorus - Eminem] - w/ ad libs
Doe ray me, you fly so latte da, don't blame me
Cause you washed up, lost your spot
I'm a stay on my side of my crusade
Ja quit playin, knock it off you're not Tupac
Don't hate me cause you hot and your not goin at me
The only shot you got
Ja quit playin knock it off you're not Tupac
And get popped like all that shit you pop
C'MON!
[Verse 3 - Kuniva]
Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs
'Til the grievance and the cryin and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga, you shook
You half of a halfway crook
Get off X's dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin old ass ignorant innocent lookin senior citizen
Built up slap you like Grandmas all sensitive
Wait a minute hold on (what's up?)
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on (*laughing*)
A bitch "Made Man", now how you gonna connect
With those short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggaz could scream holla and curse
Go ahead, respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse
[Verse 4 - Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get into +Wankstas+
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stuckin your Bridgestones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz?
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept (bitch)
When the talk get nonsense to walk in bomb threats
Contacts was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threatin at the boss you gonna see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggaz heard and they ain't scurred to bust
[Verse 5 - Kon Artis]
Yo, props to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster get jabbed in the tonsils with dicks
So much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya?
Cadillac Pac or the transvestite that dressed like a Lil' Kim fox
Your chest like a little wooden box
When I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right all the little shit you got left to help you eat
Your not Pac's souls, without laws we'll help you sleep
You got shot in your video tryin to mock Pac
You Mockaveli, get your own idea (*gunshots fired*)
[Chorus]
[Eminem - talking over the Chorus]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin punk, pussy, bitch
I'll fuck you up boy
Never, never in your motherfuckin life
Smack the shit out you little motherfuckin midget
Hailie will whip your motherfuckin ass
[Outro - Obie Trice - talking]
Yeah, that's right motherfuckers
Shady Records, what you know about?
Fuck Benzino
Fuck Ja Rule, nigga
This is Obie Trice right here talkin to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass
Yeah, fuckin Soul 4 Real ass, nigga that's Soul 4 Real
That's the nigga from Soul 4 Real
Candy reign ass nigga
He got a deal now he rappin

Faggot ass motherfuckers
Give money to all my real niggas man
Obie Trice, D-12, G-Unit
50 Cent, Hailie Jade (*echo*) (*laughing*)
[Hailie]
Daddy is Ja Rule taller than me?
[Eminem]
No honey you guys are the same size
Hey what up man? 
What up god? 
Ya heard? 
Chillen  cold as hell 
Yes it is  hey Busta didn't come here did he? 
No  hey look  you got fifteen cent? 
Nah  I got just enough to get on the bus  I'm broke 
We gotta go to the store alright man quick cause I'm short 
Yeah  we gonna have enough time to go to the store? 
Nah  look.. 
You should just  how much you got there? 
I only got 75  I'm sure I got a dollar know what I mean.. 
Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know 
You know what look, I'm sick of taking this damn bus everywhere man 
You gotta make some moves or something 
I know look, I'm trying to get rich, 
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car, 
you know what I'm saying? 
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms 
Look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something, 
you know what I'm saying? Cause I'm tired of being broke 
Verse 1: 
Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern 
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn 
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh 
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh 
Cause man I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free 
Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see 
I'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery 
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea 
But just an MC, so listen to me, but if you disagree 
You missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea 
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks 
My objects were never to swab decks 
It's up to you the decision is yours 
If what you vision is tours, or a mission less course 
When shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star 
Chorus: 
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far 
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king 
You can rule the world, you can do anything 
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star 
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far 
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king 
You can rule the world, you can do anything 
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star 
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far 
>From revenue huh 
You know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man? 
Cause that's it 
Yeah 
A million dollars ain't even that far away man 
Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life 
Yeah I hear what your saying, 
look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying? 
I can't live like this for the rest of my life man, 
bumming rides everywhere I go 
Yeah, what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'? 
Verse 2: 
Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business 
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this 
Financial interest is the matter at hand 
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand 
I grab what I can and do what I must 
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose 
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got 
Fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot 
The 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme 
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time 
My crews true and divine, we never fronted 
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred 
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives 
It's all about a man planning what his future is 
What he can do for his to be a star 
Chorus: 
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far 
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king 
You can rule the world, you can do anything 
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star 
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far 
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king 
You can rule the world, you can do anything 
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star 
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far 
From revenue huh 
That's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player, 
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be President 
Yo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king, 
making dead presidents, you know what I'm saying? 
Yeah 
Getting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that, 
you know what I'm saying? 
Yeah, I'm trying to be a millionare man, hahaha, but don't all you know 
You only live once

Yo, same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go, same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance, somethin' about it, man
Same song and dance, 'In The Pale Moonlight'
I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl, you're kind of tookin' back
By the whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard
Ya won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly buggin' ya non-stop
I walk up on ya, well, "Hello Tonya
I think ya' got your OnStar button inside your car stuck"
You outta gas, do you got the flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back, why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front, I'm not askin', it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a rap
In broad day with no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't ever gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me? Same song and dance
The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab, every four to six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
And Nickelodeon flashed her little kids once
What an event it was, I was sittin' in front
I was hooked in it, the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her back stage, now here's where I come in, son
Look here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're lookin' a little thin, hun'
How 'bout a ride to rehab, get in, cunt
It's startin' off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kiddin', let me start over again, hun'
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With sixty six inches of extension cord
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't ever gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me? Same song and dance
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst upon the scene
And seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad, it hurts
It irked me and made me mad at first
I lashed out through my songs but what was really goin' on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons
Of footage of me impalin' myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell like, "Hello, my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up"
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feelin' you, Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feelin' you, ooh, ooh girl, you sexy little gal
You hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
Come on, toots, give me the Valium alleyoop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you
Shoot, now show me how you move, baby, do how ya do
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't ever gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me? Same song and dance
Same kickin' and screamin', same cryin' and sobbin'
Same song and dance
Same diggin' and pleadin', same yellin' and bleedin'
Same song and dance
Yeah, same song and dance
I know, same song and dance
[Chorus-Akon]
I feel you creepin, I can see it from my shadow

Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboe
Then possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me
[x2]

Smack that, Give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, ohh oh oh oh oh
[Verse 1-Akon]
Up front, star ready to attack now
Pull in the parkin lot, slow with the lac down
Konvicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club,

I'm a carter then I put the mac down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now
[Chorus]
[Chorus-Akon]
I feel you creepin, I can see it from my shadow

Smack that, Give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, ohh oh oh oh oh
[Verse 2-Eminem]
Ohhhhh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a little drink on
They gon' flip for this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin like one of them putty cat dolls
Tryin to hold my woody back through my drawers
Steps on stage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me and she's like YAAAA!
I'm like "I know let's cut to the chase, no time to waste, back to my place"
Plus from the club to the crib's, like a mile away
Or more like a palace shall i say
And plus I got a pal if ya gal is game
In fact he's the one singin the song that's playin
Akon!
[Chorus]
[Chorus-Akon]
I feel you creepin, I can see it from my shadow

Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboe
Then possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me

Smack that, Give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, ohh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus-Akon]
I feel you creepin, I can see it from my shadow

Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboe
Then possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me

Smack that, Give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, ohh oh oh oh oh
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world
So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot
Think I've got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drain pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
Gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady
I'm Shady
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, took a see what it feels like
And this is how I am in real life
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice
How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they're high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife she ever saw in her life
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a 'Fuck you' letter
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady
I'm Shady
Yo, I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we're on the subject
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it
I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms
Do drink beer, I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitchin'
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for bein' AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady
I'm Shady
I told you I was Shady, yo, y'all didn't wanna believe me
I'm Shady and that's my name
Yeah whattup Detroit?
Nu uh, nu uh nuh no he didn't!
Ahh! They didn't do it again
What what, wha what?
Did you shit on these niggaz two times Dr. Dre?
Oh fo' sho'!
Uh uh, na, you smell that?
This is special right here
What what, wha what what?
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby
Uhh, to the boogie oogie oogie
Yeah, y'know! What's crackin Dre?
Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
(Limp Bizkit)
Throw on 'Guilty Conscience' at concerts
And watch mosh pits till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggaz from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggaz again
These grown ass ignorant men with hair triggers again
You and what army could harm me?
D R E and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach
  (Eastside!)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long UZ' and I carry it all day
(Blaow!)
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just bein Andre but I
Somehow, someway, hello, nigga
You know about Dogg-ay
(Snoop Dogg)
Now let me cut these niggaz up
And show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin from the shit that I be spittin' son
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang!
Damn baby girl what's your name?
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn a nigga buzzed
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem
  (Whassup Slim?)
Whattup cuz?
  (Whattup Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope done hooked up
With the King of the motherfuckin West coast, baby!
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
I'm the head nigga in charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a twelve gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please, you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
Aww naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up in the, heezy Baby
He's Sha-day!
He's so crazy!
Hahaha! Gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a living
Off of the world's misery, what in the world gives me the right
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you fagot
You happy now? Look here
I start some trouble everywhere that I go
(That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know
('Cause they know)
I start some shit they throw me out the back do'
(The back do')
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo'-fo'
(A fo'-fo')
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X To The Z, Nate Dogg

Eminem:
[WHOO] Stat
Stat Quo:

Stat Quo:
Im the next one one
Motherfuckers can't fuck with me with me
Got a problem shorty come get me, get me
Nah I ain't Dr. Dre nah I ain't Eminem or 50
Dog I'm Stat
Verse 1
Stat Quo:
As I think back retract
From the classroom to the trap
Freida's only son had to hustle for scraps
It's hard to relax when your wage minimum being broke
Fuck with my adrenaline before Dre and Eminem
I was tryna get on demo tapes state to state
Performing at clubs and doing whatever it takes
Relying on faith hoping my dreams take shape
And my fate meeting ???
I would wait for these A&R's say I ain't grind bitch
Spending my last dime on this studio time shit
A lot of folk told me I was stupid for tryin' this
Situation crucial feds off in my climate
Home environment taking pictures of me it was ugly
The spot got hot scene felt like curry
Had my vision blurry to underground Atlanta
Hit the streets me and Zeke put a plan together
Shorty it's now or never down to do whatever
You see the rainfall came but I had to bear that weather
Look your boy need cheddar like a mill or better
I was fed up but the benefit was worth the effort
Stat Quo:
I'm patiently waiting used to get love
Now the same n****Z hating wanna give me slugs
Partner donÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€t get it separated or twisted you cant fade it
Stat's the wrong motherfucker to play with understand me...>
Woah, a get your hands in the air and get to clappin' 'em
And like, back and forth because, ah
This is what you thought it wasn't
It beez the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F R O, the double G
And check out the man he goes by the name of er
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
(Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet, 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the World" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
I'm Nicer than Pete but I'm on a Search to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
(Bye, bye )
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the World" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
Somebody let me out this limousine
(Hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me
Snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the World" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck
Hey, fuck that

[Chorus]
The more you put me through, the more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on, cuz you love me and I love you more. 
It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit. We say we do it for our baby, but we don't, we do it for us. It's lust cuz neither one of us trusts the other. So we fuck till we bust. Till we cuss each other..out. We know what it's about. Shout. Till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house. I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth. Fist fight till we turn this mother out. And apologize after, laughter, pain. It's insane. We're back in the same chapter again. It's sad, but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you there ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do. 
[Chorus]
Cuz the more you put me through, the more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad, but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on. Cuz you love me and I love you more. 
Cuz I hate you, do you hate me? Good. Cuz you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry. It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you on the bed, fuck you like I don't even know you. You fuck other people, and I fuck other people. You're a slut. But I'm equal, I'm a mutt. We're both evil in our ways. But neither of us would ever admit it, cuz one of us would have one up on the other. So forget it. People can make accusations, people spread rumors.
But they ain't got proof, till they do it's just the two of us. It's just you and me. Cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me. But you gotta believe me to a degree, cause true indeed. If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' you. Yeah I would. Cuz the sex is just too damn good. If I ran who would I run to? I would be the softened one. So it's off and on, usually more off than on. But at least we know that we share this common bond. You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on. I hope the only reason that I cope is cuz of that fact. And plus I can bust in that. And that's why.
[Chorus]
The more you put me through, the more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me the more that it turns me on, cuz you love me, and I love you more. 
I could never understand it, that's why I don't try. From junior high. Until we both die. It's silly. Oh why, must we try, is it really so rough that we must always call each other billy goat's gruff? Try to pull each others legs until the other begs. We're lyin' to ourself, that's the beauty of it, yeah. Cuz we truly love each other. That's why we always fight. All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night. And it's clear, it ain't gonna change. It's pent-up rage. That we both have. We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else. We both been someone else, just someone else's, someone elses' problem, Neither one wants help.It's an addiction and it can't be fixed. Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix. And it hurts cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit. And anyone who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit! And they're probably just tired of hearing all the time. On every song, on every lyric and every rhyme. All the hoop-la, all of the whoopty-who. What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-doo. But I won't be made a fool of, and this is true love. You wouldn't know what you did last time. You wouldn't screw up this time. Cuz this time girl I'm telling you what, you do it again,I'm fuckin' you up. No matter what you say, what you do. I'm gonna hunt you down till I find you. No matter where you run, I'll be right there, right behind you in your nightmares. So all of the flowers and the candy and all of the times that you threw 'em back at me. Tell me that you hate me. You gonna hate me more, when you find out, can't escape me whore. 
[Chorus]
The more you put me through, the more it makes me wanna come back to you. You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me. I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy. The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on, cuz you love me and I love you more.

[Kuniva]
(Yo) The Derelict's back
I'm blazing niggas while they up in the Sheraton, 'laxed
I even sold my therapist crack
You niggas is bitches, straight up, I'm bearing the facts
I love pussy with all my heart, but I married a gat (gun clicks)
And nigga, I'm top pedigree, so don't play with me
I'll blow your tattoos all over your baby seat (glass shattering)
Kids an' all get hit, peers and all
The Mosberg'll take your back, liver, ribs and all (bah!)
Kuniva's a street talker
Heatsparker to beefstarter
Packing guns when I'm sleepwalking (Bitch, Keep Talkin')
Throw a firebomb down your chimney
While you're eating at Wendy's, I'm in your bushes cockin' a semi
Knife with the hands, never bow down to another man
I was poppin' guns while you was still poppin' some rubber bands
Smother your clan!
Sever your hand and your legs
And mail your brother your heart, and send your mother your head!
[Swift]
I'm the only one, you bitch, that touch ya
Type of brother that'll fuck your mother
With a fishnet rubber (scream)
A belligerent and rowdy motherfucka
That'll dump your body, and still fly away to Maui on Atella
When it comes to beefin', it ain't no explainin'
I change your language with a stainless
I'm contained with an anguish to leave you famous
I'm a deranged pit, I left an AK to paint your face with
Niggas don't say shit, fuck your hype man
If there's a bystander standing by, I'm firin' at him! (Flat out)
Cause I can, You get squashed like pop cans
I'll be shooting 7 up in your mouth, man (ha, ha, ha)
I'm about to sell your mama bud, and lace it
So when she fire it up she coughin' blood
I love to see 'em lay shit
I'm made to behave in this case
You try to be brave in a rage your legs will be replaced
[Eminem]
Bitch, Keep Talkin'
Keep on poppin off, flip them jaws because

You ain't stoppin' us!
We ain't got to prove shit to yall
So all yall can lick the balls and
Keep Walkin'!
(Bizzy, come on!)
[Bizarre]
I ain't here to talk about Benzino, or Ja Rule
I'm here to talk about lil' Ray Ray, and what I'ma do (laugh)
Sorry, I ain't gonna mention you, you'll probably sue
Next week, this shit'll be out on DJ Clue (exclusive!)
The first time I had sex, a dirty mattress
No condom, my grandmother bent over backwards (Ugh!)
Bizarre been fuckin' raw all summer
Let's make a trade: My wife for your brother
Syke! I'm not bisexual
I'm an intellectual transexual with one testicle (One nut)
And I ain't saying shit 'cause it rhyme
I got colon cancer...I'm dyin
[Proof]
(Yay Yay!)
Rest in peace Jammaster Jay, 2pac, and Notorious Big (Fo' Sho')
(Come on)I'm probably the best
God in the flesh
Blow your heart out of your chest
And your chest out of your vest
Leave your body a mess, streets bloody as hell
Study my 12, I cut him he fell
A druggie on bail, nutty as well
With search light, bud he revealed
Dead or in jail
They're headed for hell...
Together with bells and blonde guy
Get your lungs hard
Leave you full of holes like Spongebob (Gunshots)
We can take this from your front door to your CEO office
Got the key to your coffin to pee on you often
Leavin' your office, we takin' over
Or get China White, mixed with baking soda
Ya hear me...GET CRACK!
[Eminem]
Fuckin' Crackheads!
And this is just mixtape shit, you fuckin' morons!
This ain't brains over brawn
This is bullies over fuckin' pussies!
(Laugh) Come on!
Bitch, Keep Talkin'
Keep on poppin off, flip them jaws because
We ain't stoppin'
We ain't got to prove shit to yall
So all yall can lick the balls and
Keep Walkin'!
Keep on poppin' that shit you poppin'
Cause we ain't stoppin' cause

So all yall can lick the balls and
Keep Walkin'!
(guns cocking then one gunshot)
[Eminem:] Haha
[Ca$his:] Ca$his, Ca$his
[Eminem:] Yeah!
[Ca$his:] King Mathers
[Eminem:] C'MON!
[Ca$his:] Pistol poppin, come get me nigga! (echoes)
(Chorus: Ca$his)
Pistol poppin, bodies droppin, layin all around
You thought it was a game, now the neighbors callin out
The police find that, what's that sound?
While you layin on the ground with your fuckin brain out
(Ca$his:)
Walk through the door with my hands on a gun
Cause niggaz 'round here wanna ask where I'm from
I throw up my signs, step back and pop one
'fore you throw up your sign if you even got one
I used to bust niggaz heads open for fun
Chase him down, stomp him out, if he tried to run
I could flip packs, get stacks, big straps, where it at?
Slung crack, real cat, you ain't never did that
Go hard, no peace, I gotta keep, chrome heat
I don't sleep, homie I'm watched by the police
Cops out patrolling, grab a glock-40
Sniper at the squad car, story noting
Fuck it if you want beef, click-clack, wack rap
Tossed straps before, I'm out of here, homie
Militant in a sense, I don't really give a shit
Call up, Eminem, I gotta plead innocent
(chorus)
(Ca$his:)
Sixteenth in my sneakers, I ain't listen to my teachers
I'm the most hated nigga alive, since Jesus
Maybe in the afterlife they'll reveal my Christ-like abilities
Come back, then ride on my enemies
Never been afraid of beef, metals of my bravery
War situations got you sayin he, crazy G
And emerge with the beat, I can serve anything
Especially anybody tryin to diss my team  Shady
[blam] G-Unit, Aftermath the same thing
So if you say them punk nigga you say me
I be in L.A. G, get at me when you see me
Catch you in O.C., and in the bag you'll be leaving
I ain't worried 'bout my freedom cause for me to get even
Is worth e'rything, it's on B.B.G.N.
I son'd you folk, I'm lookin at your pinkie
You a fake-ass gangsta, what a waste of my scenery
(chorus x2)
(Eminem:)
Maybe I just feel like there's too many pussies in rap
Shady (Ca$his) we gotta push 'em to the back
Move 'em along, push 'em aside, don't get me wrong
I love the finger snaps and the claps into the song
It's got a catch but come on man, the raps
We all gotta step our game up; especially these lame fucks
Who walk around with their chest out
Just tryin to be down with anybody who's left now
Better be down with them, huh
But I dare some bitch to say somethin about, Eminem
Cause I'm not in the mood to be playin around with dudes
I already seen two friends get shot in the head
And lay on the ground this year and, one didn't make it
Proof, you are the truth
Please don't let us come face to face with these boo-boo-hoo
Fake-ass tattooed havin
Fif' please tell 'em right now how hard it has been
For me to try and, stay out it
But they just won't quit runnin their mouth
At least 'til there's a gun in it; son of a bitch!
We all got shooters, yeah these days who doesn't?
And as far as the snaps and claps, I wasn't
Dissin the South, that isn't what this is about
I just so sick of the beef, I don't even wanna see anymore
(chorus x2)
I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're mean yo mean yeah man
You are just jealous of me
'Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cuz you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes close them
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo?
Hippity ca-ca boo-boo
Psych, I'm kidding
I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
Ok, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
From the moment that I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me
Is it just because
You are just jealous of me
'Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cuz you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cuz it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright now, aww shit I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't, it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay
You're droolin', you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'n' Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
You sir are on truth syrum
Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
It's my own insecurity
You are just jealous of me
'Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cuz you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie
Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how about now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me
Lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this
This is torturous my point is this
That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, your just is
You are just jealous of me
'Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cuz you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cuz you're just really jealous of me
'Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie
Fuck off my dick, heheheheheheium
Yo! Turn that click offÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢€ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â¦
My music is soothing
But its also been provin
That it can put you in the mood to 
jump out your car while it's movin
You been waitin' on this moment
My sermon is like a omen
I'm servin' I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open 
And I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book
Go ahead and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it
Rummage,and find something
you can use to jump someone
And roll up bumpin
I'm constantly copin' over you
Squattin', shit has gotten to the point
Where I ain't even writin' no more, I'm just jottin'
This is chicken scratch, shit is sickenin'
I've been kickin' ass off bullshit
Throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy
Ive made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat, you Cannabis
Then it's Dre's fee, you Kay Slay the fees waved
I stay beefin' with JD, till the day Dre 2-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazin' him
Oops! I put it out, I apologize now
It's too late G, it's on tape
And the tape leaped, "Say What You Say" mothafucka
Drama King, Kay Slay, mothafucka, We dictate these mixtapes mothafucka
Xzibit blaze little gay midget cocksucka
Yeah, yeah, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's all so cold, all so cold, oh
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake
Fe fi fo fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target with my car and park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider
Hi there, girl, you mighta heard of me before
See whore, you're the kinda girl that I'da
Assault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella, then open it up while that shit's inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah, and now let's see her have triplets and I'll
Incinerate them babies soon as they're out her with formaldehyde
Hide in cyanide, girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin' I'd rather go vin-vin and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, ahh
Shit, wait a minute, I mean skull, my knife seems dull
Pull another one out, ooh
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide and seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Close the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatantly but silently 'cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's wakin' me so violently and why's he on top of me?
"He's rapin' me", she tries to scream
"Somebody please get him off me"
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughin' like it's funny"
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me
She's scratchin' like some dumb freak
Escapin' me, no die, she see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancin' in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancin' to quite a different drum beat
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake
Better try to stay wide awake
Or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitches soul, I'ma try to take
Pray for light today, right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much
Might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how about now while you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours till outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement now?
Ya must've just heard the sound
Of my stomach growlin' from down there
Holler, there's no one fowler
Bound to the tub they found ya' face down in the tub
I drowned you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cowered
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' 'Star Wars'
Jaba the hut, be, de, ba, ba, be, de, ba, ba, it's time to die, die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazin' when grazin' skin with these razorblades he waves at ya'
Not your everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothin' like Son of Sam, so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt?
There's no fun in that, here I come with ax
Fun to act like lumberjack, when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 911, someone's comin' in from the back
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

By jay z / freeway
Yeah renegades is back and the beat is sick,
Jay z, freeway, 8 miles,
Let's go...
Verse 1
8 miles and running, got my 7 album droppin,
And my 8 album coming,
Feedin a thousand growling stomachs,
But I could rewind the counter ta back, back,
When it was now or nothing,
People said I would amount to nothing,
That I had time for nothing,
Said I wasn't from the valers
Or the sellers by your gunman,
I can see the folks now he got what he had coming,
Now that my 8th album's coming,
Everybody smiling wanting something,
Claiming that they done something for em,
Got jay z and pom poms in they whole uniforms,
Claiming they be running and telling everybody like martin lawrence,
About how hot my rap performace was before I was who I was,
Claimin that they threw it up before I threw it up, you what..
Where was you before I blew this up,
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everyone was suein us,
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin up,
Back on the block, kickin it in and it was no you with us,
Chorus
8 miles and running, got my 7 album droppin,
And my 8 album coming,
Feedin a thousand growling stomachs, freaks...
6 miles and running got my fist straight poppin,
And my first album coming feedin 20 promises I made
(repeat)
Verse 2
6 miles and running in the pontiak,
6 thousand 86 trans mic shift,
While the engine run,
Anyone turn around
And give me one more chance,
Let em smoke and scream em one more grams,
So I'm a bring them, homie, son and my pop,
Stick close to my momma, keep toasters for drama,
Mix alot with my son, my son growin and he learnin alot,
Thats what I'm toastin, thats what I'm burin, so pop,
Right on your own, rell 'em nigga, tell 'em nigga,
Its like a biblical scripture,
Look back turn to salt like the sinners
And most y'all heartless and self-centered
Like me shaggin, me shack,
Set up your brother cause you tell us nigga,
Heat back, uh, like, you never love for never
And cops watch every step, 6 miles and running
Dodge in every trap, the rap ginger bread man,
Cherish every precious breath, stat pick a second gat
Uh..
Chorus
Verse 3
Back when nobody would find me a talent,
Nobody would sign me, nobody believed in me,
Nobody but mommy blindly, but how could she deny me,
Me being the youngest friend to come up out of her,
Tell me, she got every love for me,
When niggas would worn me the industry shun me,
That's why I'm taking all the industries money,
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this,
Young is the illest, free is the future,
Beans and bleekers right now,
We can see our 8 miles nigga...
Chorus
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want them fans jumpin'
I want them fists pumpin' in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't you fill your cups?
Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much T-N-T
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Can help you to resuscitate, you bustas must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came and crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them 'cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear a skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit is getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
Da dee da dee da da dee
He makes it look so easy
Girl you just hit the lottery
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
This is where shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say, and once it's over like a seance, it hums
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smokin' something
You think I ain't smokin' nothin, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
I'm like a goose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to extract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your man's like in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm murdering the flow, liquid courage up in the blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block with your hoe
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc
Can proceed to drop me and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door
Yeah, so let us in before we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out your
Revenge is so sweet, move it 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT
Yeah, my sayings are sewers in the streets
Them haters hating on me
But I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce deuce in the seat, Dre fall off?
That's news to me
Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
The Wild.. Gotham
The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}
Ha ha, riiiiide..
[Dr. Dre]
All you see is the sun, reflectin off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin gold, waitin for this drama to unfold
I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
but I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
[Eminem]
You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
but I know you - the name's Slim - you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you..
Chorus: {unknown singer}
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
[Dr. Dre] + (Eminem)
He was "Shady," I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
The Chronic!
(Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(And plus I know who's got it)
Who?
(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)
(Eminem)
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin around sayin he took the game from us
[Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin]
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
[Dr. Dre]
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a "G Thang,"
and a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin"
I said "It's Dre's Day," and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin every which way
(Eminem)
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled
Chorus 2X
Always die..
The Wild.. Gotham
The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}
Ha ha, riiiiide

[Verse 1 - Eminem] 
It's like a throne that he dont even own 
He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around 
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing 
He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry 
He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in it for a sport 
Runnin suckaz where theres competition round the court 
He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it 
And you cant love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it 
You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short 
But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it 
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys 
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks] 
He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate 
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate 
Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate 
And he hops in a 100 thousand with a Nigga's gate 
House with just a bigger gate , houndin him was a big mistake 
He wont surrender he'll rather give up a rib to break 
'cause he remembers when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand 
So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan 
Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name 
When you discussin' the illest playa that's in the game 
And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them 
G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them

He's no magician man the kid makes somethin' outta nuthin
So now niggaz from this hood act like we owe em somethin 
They talk crazy til we send niggas through there to buck em 
Ask 'em if theres a problem and they'll say naw its nothin 
He was gonna help em out, but since they fronted, fuck em 
He dont care how they feel, they can hate him or love him
He hold it down on his own the kid is really thuggin 
He's rich now, he aint change so Niggaz think he buggin 
He bullet proof everything in case niggaz try and buff him
Keep Two pistols on this hip I show you where he tuck em 
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they cant touch him 
Try to catch em slippin, they creepin and he start bustin

I can give you niggaz' somethin' you can talk about 
I can turn your smile upside down 
You ain't no G-Unit fuckin' clown 
I can take your girl until I turn her out
Don't hold it in, let it all out
I can give you fuckers somethin' to be mad about
Invite her in send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth.

I'll shit on you, da, da, da, da
I'll shit on you, da, da, da, da
I'll shit on you, da, da, da, da
I'll shit on you, da, da, da, da
I'll shit on you, I will shit
I'll shit on you, girl, you know
I'll shit on you, bitch or man
I'll shit on you, I will shit
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin' bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef, I got you hoes duckin' me
A drug thief, bitch, I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep yo ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred-degree saunas
You can act a fool if you wanna
(Bitch)
It's this lyrical piranha, strapped with a grenade
In the pool with your mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin' up like a condom
Slap it if you muthafuckas got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes endin' up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BMW
Pull in the garage while you screamin'
Keep the motor on, then I'm leavin'
I'll shit on you
I will shit on you, I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you, I don't give a fuck about you or your car
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry
And fuck your watch, fuck your wife
Fuck your kids, fuck your family, I'll shit on you
I'm a alcoholic with the fuckin' toilet
Pass the hot dogs, bitch, shut your fuckin' mouth
(Bizarre, aren't you Islamic?)
I'ma keep eatin' till Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
I'm to busy fuckin', your 12 year old baby sitter
And all women ain't shit, only good for cookin'
Cleanin', and suckin' dick and that's it
I was responsible for killin' John Candy
I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my 98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are, I'll shit on anybody
Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre
My adolescent years weren't shit to what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit I get in
The more ignorant the incident is I fit in
Ignorin' the shit, how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
It's they who raised me and say the can take me
It's they who's legs I brake and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so angry
I'll shit on you, I'll spit on you
Start pissin' then do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said, I'll cop a squat on you and
Start spillin' my guts like chicken cordon bleu
And straight shit like notorious big did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album, pull my pants down
I will shit on you, I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you, I don't give a fuck about you or your car
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry
And fuck your watch, fuck your wife
Fuck your kids, fuck your family, I'll shit on you
Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin'
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang it
Bitch, brang it, these niggas that I hang wit
Will hang you up naked by your ankles danglin'
My needa stays stranglin', I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy, I'll unloosen my belt
I'll punch your daddy not, your moms kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck 50 cross yo neck, floss yo tek
I'll beat you wit it across yo chest
It's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk, I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat your peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in choke holds, I learned last week
From the police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
I see hoes bitin', y'all don't wanna brawl
Thats like D-bo fightin' Peablo Bryson
So, what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin' skeleton out
Niggas get hit wit a two piece, bling, bling
With a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing
I will shit on you, I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you, I don't give a fuck about you or your car
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry
And fuck your watch, fuck your wife
Fuck your kids, fuck your family, I'll shit on you
Once I get on 2 hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts 5 more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets, who pack 10, 9 millimetres
5 criminals pullin' heaters and spillin' liters of blood like swimmin' pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too
A lotta people say misoginistic which is true
I don't deny it, matter of fact, I stand by it
So, please stand by it and start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child, I'll shit on you
I will shit on you, I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you, I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you, fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you, I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me, I'll shit on you
You heard me, bitch, I'll shit on you, D-12 will shit on you, I'll shit on you
Your life, your wife, your kids, your car
I'll shit on you, your house, your spouse
Your rings, your things
I'll shit on you, I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you, I'll shit on you
Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the TriBeCa
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy, Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I buy sex and erect ya'
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya'
I tantalize ya' and in less then 5 seconds I get ya'
They say once bitten and twice shy
Well, I'm next to the guy with 9 ecstasy pills and 5 extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities
Why? Yes sir, I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop kicked the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter
Then I guess, I'll dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
All my West Side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, quief and blow it up
Man, I think that Eggers fell off the tip, didn't show enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man, you've seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no, you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I'll do what I wanna
Spray perfume in a sauna room, crazy gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that man who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived her life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man?
Grab a hold of this branch with both hands
Man, they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
This name rhymes with so many different words, geez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please
Eminem, I'm coming to kill you
Always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break dance if you think you're hardcore
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
The world is mine
[Police voice:]
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next
[Verse 1:]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks
[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
[Verse 2:]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys
[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
[Verse 3:]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"
[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
[Verse 4:]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
[Verse 5:]
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone
[Police voice:]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?
[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Well Jimmy Moved in with his mother

This aint cool
I'm in a rage 
He's tappin my mom n we almost the same age
On the microphone i drop bombs 
Look at this car thanx alot mum
Here happy birthday rabbit
Heres a brand new car you can have it
A nine-teen twenty-eight Delta
This shit wont even get me 2 tha shelter! 
And i cant even say im from mo-town 'cause 
Im back in the 810 now
'Coz i live at home in a trailer mum im cumming home to you!
Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment 
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo 
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now 
The clock's run out, time's up, over, BLOW! 
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad 
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it 
He knows his whole back's to these ropes 
It don't matter, he's dope 
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't colapse on him 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping 
This world is mine for the taking, make me king 
As we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post-mortar 
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter 
Lonely roads, god only knows he's grown farther from home 
He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water 
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows 
He nose dove and sold nada 
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner 
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage 
Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged 
I was playin' in the beginnin, the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin', stepped writin' the next cypher 
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my nine to five 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
Cuz man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers 
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer 
This is my life, and these times are so hard 
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus 
Teetertotter caught up between bein a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna 
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony 
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not 
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go with my shot, feet fail me not 
This may be the only opportunity that I got 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
Okay, guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop, pajama time
Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's okay
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
It's Friday and it's my day
Used to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?
Man you must be up out yo mind
Dre, ah, ah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby (ah ah)
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' "Ah ah ah ah"
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said. "Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's '8 Mile' now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit
Oh you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba
I don't have any lines to go right here so tubba
Tellytubby fellas, what, fellas, what
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous what
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'
It's the season, just go ah ah ah ah, it's so appeasin'
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass, whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world, alright now lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby
(Ah ah)
Oh baby, baby
(Ah ah)
Touch my body, touch my body
Oh boy just touch my body, I mean girl just touch my body
[scratched sample] - "I'm the man!"
I stand in, ?? by the way as i begin
do you know who I am? and may reply with a grin
yes, I'm tired of being ??
why should I be secluded, I got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, "Eminem will you kick it for me?"
So I find myself in a certain ??depligatory??
A place where I dwell in, ?? for some wonderful productions
to make up for lost time, ??
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
a mental projectile, I aim like a reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
"Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?"
Is there a reason for this? the hatred is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
there's so much more to learn, it pages left to be read,
so put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
while i hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
words can weigh a ton
therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one
[scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another..
There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
The world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling
"Oh foolish pride, what the hell is you tryin to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to"
The outcome we want ?? nothing ?? despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless and
You're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverence of a starchild
Rest with formidable talent and versitility
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty
To infridge on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refuser abusin it's accepted now it's a trend
[scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another..."
You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No? so then why do you speak for me
and every other white man when you that we're your enemy?
On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But I've ?? apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite, now see it being re-enacted
Pull up the ?? quick,
These ?? we hate him, these ?? are past us, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to proove myself, time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
And ??bluffing?? with nothing to say, stutterin and slurrin
And mutterin words with no meaning, attack me side I'm like ??Danny K/Danny Kane??
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
and eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving
[scratched sample until end] - "I'm the man"
(Dido) 
My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why 
I got out of bed at all. 
The morning rain clouds up my window, 
but I can't see at all. 
Even if I could, it'd all be grey, 
but you're picture on my wall. 
It reminds me that it's not so bad, not so bad. 
(Eminem as Stan) 
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'. 
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom. 
I sent two letters back in autumn; you must not-a got 'em. 
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'. 
Sometimes, I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em, 
but anyways, F- it. What's been up, man? How's you're daughter? 
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm about to be a father. 
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? 
I'ma name her Bonnie. 
I read about your Uncle Ronnie,too. I'm sorry. 
I had a friend kill himself over some chick who didn't want him. 
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan. 
I even got the underground stuff you did with Scam. 
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man. 
I like the stuff you did with Ruckus, too. That guy was fat. 
Anyways, I hope you get this, man. Hit me back, just to chat. 
Truly yours, your biggest fan. 
This is Stan. 
(Repeat chorus) 
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote. I hope you get a chance. 
I ain't mad. I just think it's SCREWED UP that you don't answer fans. 
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew. 
He's my little brother, man. He's only six years old. 
We waited in the blistering cold for you. 
4 hours and you just said "No". 
That's pretty crummy, man. You're like his favorite idol. 
He wants to be just like you, man. He likes you more than I do. 
I ain't that mad, though. I just don't like being lied to. 
Remember when we met back in Denver, you said if I write you 
you'd write back. See, I'm just like you in a way. 
I never knew my father, neither. 
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her. 
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs, 
so when I have a crummy day, I drift away and put 'em on 
cause I don't really got nothin' else 
so that stuff helps when I'm depressed. 
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest. 
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds. 
It's like adrenaline. The pain is such a sudden rush for me. 
See, everything you say is real, and I respect it cause you tell it. 
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7, 
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim. No one does. 
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up. 
You gotta call me, man. I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose. 
Sincerely yours, Stan 
P.S. We should be together, too. 
Repeat chorus 
Dear Mr I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans, 
this'll be the last package I ever send your @$$. 
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it? 
I know you got my last two letters. 
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect. 
So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it. 
I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway. 
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka. You dare me to drive? 
You know that song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night" 
about that guy that coulda saved that other guy from drowning, 
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then later at a show he found 'em? That's kinda how this is. You coulda saved me from drowning. 
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers, now. I'm drowsy' and all I wanted was a lousy 
letter or a call. 
I hope you know I ripped ALL you're pictures off the wall. 
I love you, Slim. We coulda been together; think about it. 
You've ruined it, now. I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it 
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it. 
I hope you're conscience EATS at you and you can't BREATHE without me! 
See Slim,(backround screaming) Shut up, slut! I'm tryin' to talk! 
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk, 
but I didn't slit her throat. I just tied her up. See I ain't like you cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more , then she'll die too. 
Well, gotta go. I'm almost at the bridge, now. 
Oh shoot, I forgot. How'm I supposed to send this tape out?! 
(car tires squeal, CRASH, a brief silence, A LOUD splash) 
(Repeat chorus) 
(Eminem as Slim Shady) 
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy 
You said you're girlfriend's pregnant, now. How far along is she? 
Look, I'm really flattered you'd call you're daughter that. 
And here's an autograph for Matthew. I wrote it on the Starter cap. 
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show. I musta missed you. 
Don't think I did that stuff intenionally just to diss you. 
But what's this you said about you like to cut you're wrists, too? 
I say that stuff just clownin', dogg. C'mon, how messed up is you? 
You got some issues, Stan. I think you need some councelin' 
to help your butt from bouncin off the walls when you get down some. 
And what's this about us meant to be together? 
That type of junk will make me not want us to meet each other. 
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other 
or maybe you just need to treat her better. 
I hope you get to read this letter. I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself. I think you'll be doin' just fine 
if you relax a little. I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan, 
why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan. 
I just don't want you to do some crazy stuff. 
I saw this one thing on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick. 
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid. 
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to. 
Come to think about it. His name was... It was you. 
DAMN! 
Yeah
It's my life
In my own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
"Daddy look what I made," dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?"
I don't know, go play Haile, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Haile on a swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making mommy cry" Why? Why is mommy crying?
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying"
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy, you're mine"
She's piling boxes in front of the door, trying to block it
"Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy, no stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe daddy, take it witcha'"
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These stinkin' walls must be talking, 'cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying, "You got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight, now go out there
And show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy it's me, help mommy, her ****** are bleeding"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'"
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
But baby wait, "It's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another ****
Yeah, I bet you you will, you rap about it
Yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
I turn around, find a *** on the ground, **** it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die Shady" and *** it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Haile's outside swinging
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Haile just smiles
And winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

OK, got it, on 3...1, 2, 3
Hu-let's move...
Skylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around
With my dear Veronica
Wait a minute, you hold hold it right there
Me and that woman love each other
Love, what do you know of love?
We were destined to be together I met her on the beach
Are you out to destroy me?
No Roger that's not what I want to do
I love her, and we're going to be together
Never
Check, check 1, 2, 1, 2 1, 2, it's rolling
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dr. Dre up in here y'all know what this is
It's what y'all been waiting for funk master Flex, Big Kap
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby
Yo, Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is, baby
I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it ain't latching and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation? Come on
Anyway I got down with Dre, what up?
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the police"
When you still had your mother's fucking nipple stuck in your teeth
Fucking baby, became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holla, "Bravo"
Hell yeah, I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't
'Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
Wanna fight?
I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady
Dr Dre
I'm drunk pass the tec
'Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
'Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake, don't get so bent out of shape
'Cause I went out and raped six girl friends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove, hello, where you at?
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you, lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change 'cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it moving, off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do
Oooh! Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes
400 assaults, and 4 murders, the undisputed, most diabolical
Villain in the world, Slim Shady!
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Ok, let's go
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I'm laying the cut
Missed the cut, the lady give a eighty some paper cut
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance and hit the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio is back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre
They see that low rider go by they're like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
Its what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajauan do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Cho shoes I say move a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Whoo, hey, how you guys doin'?
You want more?
Alright, then shut up
Shoo bee doo
  (Shoo bee doo)
Shoo bee doo
  (Shoo bee doo)
Shoo bee doo
  (Shoo bee doo)
Shoo bee doo
Shoo bee, snoo be dee bee bop
Girl
(Girl, girl, girl)
You're my world
(World, world world)
You're my girl
(Girl, girl girl)
You're my world
(World, world, world)
Here's a song for da ladies
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love it, the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it
Wait, where you going? I'm leaving you, no, you ain't
Come back, we're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back
She's Lois Lane but when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much, you could barely breathe when you with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know it hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others face spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each others hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the race that took over, it controls you both
So they say you'd best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over
But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it "window pane"
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed
And set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Yeah
God damn
Feels like a long time does it?
Did you miss us?
We missed you!
Ha ha

that's creepin upon me why I'm so high
maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me I don't mind
your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the drill
spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
you're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel
like I don't think anyone's real, 
faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama, 
don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama
don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer, 
be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
how many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row, 
put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,
name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper, 
location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped, 
the trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate 
and which motel which lake they found her in, 
and how they attacked the victim, 
say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,
which night it was done, what kid would write there was none, 
so sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes
it must be the ganja
it's the marijuana
that's creepin upon me why I'm so high
maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me I don't mind
it must be the ganja
it's the marijuana
that's creepin upon me why I'm so high
maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me I don't mind
when I'm behind a mic dynamite is what its kinda like
get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light
behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms
heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some, 
he can give her some, she can give him some
get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome
you're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm
starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up
capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a
titanium brain thats full of, surprises
when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes 
you stare into your stereos eyes
good evening, this isnt't even a weed thing, 
I didn't even smoke anything , I didn't even drink anything 
it must be the ganja
it's the marijuana
that's creepin upon me why I'm so high
maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me I don't mind
it must be the ganja
it's the marijuana
that's creepin upon me why I'm so high
maybe it's the hinde that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me I don't mind
Big Proof, rest in peace dudey, we love you
We just wanna keep makin' you proud
My life is trapped in these lines
That's why I'm packin' these nines
I got a rap I ain't dyin'
Thats in the back of my mind
Got a strap made of iron
Can't relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers
'Til I'm snappin' my spine
Natural high I gotta focus
On these bogus pochers
Lookin' over my shoulder
Proof get it poppin' like show'd a hold up
We nothin' but soldiers
Slow up
This car 'n it's loaded
Roll up
They beef 'n we leavin' 'em coked up
If Em say it I spray it
If he will it I kill it
We kilpatrick 'n ill it
Yo Detroit, know I can feel it
Will at this gun on my waistline
At war we don't waste time
Blow up magic can't take a punch
And fifty can take 9
We got schoolcraft
Here at the seven-eight and dexter
I'm up 'n holla spendin' dollas
Ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes suh', ya texta' is bitch
Bet'chya ya flinch
When Proof shoot up they crew
And wet ya whole clique
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
  (Yeah, it's been a ride)
Everybody, everybody
  (I guess I had to)
Come take my hand, come take my hand
  (Go to that place to get to this one)
We'll walk this world together through the storm
  (Now some of you)
Whatever weather, cold or warm
  (Might still be in that place)
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
  (If you're tryin' to get out)
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
  (Just follow me, I'll get you there)
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something, I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearing down your balcony
No if, ands, or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to that last "Relapse" album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck-you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got
The urge to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was the king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD, was "eh"
Perhaps I ran the max and since hit the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click clack, pow
'Cause I ain't playin' around, it's the game called circlin'
I don't know how, I'm way too rough to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons, these motherfuckers are doing jumping-jacks now
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Tryin' to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the ringer, but take it through little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers
No more drama, from now on I promise to only focus
On handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquour counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars I feel amazin'
And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
You know I just don't get it, last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me? Ten million dollars
Get the fuck out of here
You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers, I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
With it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist poppin' and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty six year old skinny Cartman
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded?  Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good-ol' fashioned
Passionate ass-whoopin' and gettin' your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New kids on the block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy-girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you fagots in public
I'ma love it
Vanilla Ice don't like me, said some shit in vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin', "I don't care, just bite me"
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4 year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in fagots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer
Fagot to dope and silent gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' fagots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paint balls shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim anus you damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming fagots
'Coz I'm, just Marshall Mathers
I'm not a wrestler guy I'll knock you out if you talk about me
Come and see me on the streets alone, if you assholes doubt me
And if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot at me
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
It is fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC get bizzy
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter your, fagot!
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see?  A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Here, double XL, double XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself
'Coz I'm, just Marshall Mathers, I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me
'Coz I'm, just Marshall Mathers, I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me
[Eminem]
Fuck an intro man, let's go... 
I come around like what goes around.
What goes up must come down.
Anyone who comes up must go down.
Might as well go for the gusto now.
Better not let up, better not let them breathe.
Last shot give it all you got.
Try to turn me down bitch get fucked with the volume nob,
Fuck all you snobs.
Hoes I hope all you rot.
Two bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought?
And you wanna manage a trois, you twots?
Fuck that I'd rather turn this club to a ballroom brawl.
Get as rowdy as Roesthlisberger in a bathroom stall.
Like a leaf stuck in a vacuum ya'll ain't nothtin but a whole lot of suckin' goin' on in rap.
Yeah but I'm home.
Bad to the bone, back in the zone
Let him alone,
You don't wanna go eggin' him on.
It'll never be my chair that you're on.
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain, no oxygen.
Otherwords there's no heir to the throne.
When I die so does hip hop.
Hitchcock better shit bitch ass gotgot a zip locked in a bag.
You fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top.
Keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone, like I'm in the twilight dog get off my bone this is my mic doggone it I like hogging it.
Flow so wet I'ma take this beat tobogganin.
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it.
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it.
Suplexin it on cement, like I'm on some straight outta compton shit
Take this dick and chomp on it.
I'm so bad I can bitch slap a back handed compliment.
Jackass eat a donkey dick.
The game I just about conquered, it like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit, I reign supreme in this honkey shit.
No sense screaming and arguing.
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in.
You think you ball, well I palm it.
I throw up bombs when I vomit.
Boy I throw down in the kitchen, might hit your mom with my omelet.
But you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic.
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze.
Bitch I'm as bat shit as Ozzy, it's obvious, you can tell I go right off the bat.
No pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head.
Tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web, I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage.
I catch a fly in that bitch. 
You think you fly, you just food.
I give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude.
Guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and bamboozled, confused as usual, and you can get ripped she can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat, or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
I came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken.
Yeah, it's Shady slut, the rest can suck on a big one.
'Cause I'm despicable as daffy duck when I'm spitting.
(Haha recovery)
[End]
Man, let's go
Hey yo Fif'
Yeah?
Call 'em and tell 'em
It's time to hate us again
We're back
Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care
You can be black white or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
'Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
From out of nowhere you might just find your career
Come to with eek and I'm just like, oh yeah

Where the fuck we goin' we're like nowhere
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit let them talk shit 'cuz they talk shit
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it
'Cuz no one wants to walk around stepinin' dog shit
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em inside they like go get 'em
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um
Shady Limiteds in any size yo denim to velor

Meanwhile your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah

Beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak man sometimes we share

You probably heard about me I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin' like I'm running for mayor
Running winding doning and shining you know what I'm saying

I'm making hits my homies taking hits whose staying
See us on the award shows and we're like, oh yeah
Can we get more of those they like, oh yeah
See us keep blowing up we're like, oh yeah
So Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos I'm like, oh yeah

The laugh

You don't think they gonna think we're really crazy right?
Slim mother fuckin' Shady....alright 
Missy Elliot, Timbo, c'mon, yo 
Verse 1: 
I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends 
holdin a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends 
sprayin' techs at you 
until you see your fuckin legs with the bullets holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you. 
fuckin' mad dog, foamin' out the mouth 
fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin' out the couch 
jumped outta a 93 floor of a buildin' 
and shot every window out on the way to the ground(keep filmin) 
woke up to a hospital staff 
got up and laughed 
chopped em in half 
and sufficated your oxygen mask 
Shit if I get any higher ima get the east and west beefin' again 
fly back to Detroit and stand in the cross-fire 
(Ken Kaniff's voice) oh fuck...oh shit 
I got the hotel room ready 
what time are you gettin off.....work 
or shall I say [Eminem - aight, yo, yo, yo one more time, yo]
what time are you comin' over 
Verse 2: 
yo, yo, im only smilin' when im violent, 
got on the plane wylin, 
told the pilot to fly me to Tylenol Island 
stewardess like "you restless?" 
"no bitch, im restful so hold this fuckin jet still so i can eat these pretzels" 
Forget school, 
the other kids are disrespectful, 
they hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles 
I can't take it 
i'm tryin to gain weight, 
so I eat steak 
and swallow the whole plate 
and weigh myself, naked 
without albums 
to teach kids family values 
'cause every mom and dad should allow you to pop valiums 
and never hit someone unless you got a reason 
and if there ain't a reason 
make one up - start swingin'
Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms.Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me? Well I'm back
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
Hum-die-die-la-la-la

Artist: dj spinna f/ eminem, thirstin howl iii
Verse one (thirstin howl):
I hit harder
Than forman
Landing both both gloves to a low blow
With no cup
Leave you speech-less like when arrested development broke up
Carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
Crack skulls
Through helmets
With the penetration of a screw nailed in
Return like I was sending self addressed postage
Throw bricks the size of the stonehenge
Before battles, we pour blood
And toast, death to wicked infants
Found on the sorceress' doorsteps
Slaughter lamb
And boar's head
Every mc's cause of boredness
And mind bondage
Bronchitis, lung failure
Language unfam-i-liar
Art through a flooded air brush
? ? ? leave craft
Sentences joined with words holding hands
It's a tight squeeze
From where your head will be landing
In exact time flight leaves
<watch this>
<watch this>
<watch this>
<don't watch that, watch this>
Verse two (eminem):
Who's arm is this? 
I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
And refused to resume my severed prescription of ? ? ? 
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
And never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life
That's why I degrade my wife
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich
And just ate the knife
My mother's screaming 'please heal him, take him straight to christ'
Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
I was probably just tryin to shake the lice
Bugs fallin' out of my head
I'm wishin' I was dead
While I'm crawlin out of my bed
Found it red
And my rash is returning
I feel the sensation of burning
Occurring, usually during pain for release in my urine
Screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'
These pills keep screamin' 'please quit swollin' me'
The devil keeps screamin' 'please get down on one knee'
Took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me
<watch this>
<watch this>
<watch this>
<don't watch that, watch this>
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you
I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
And in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel dissin' again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I can't just sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like
To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others' eyes
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check
The temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
And so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door
For conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Ha! Marshall you're so funny man
You should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like
To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
Every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
And Edna always told me
Keep making that face and it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue tryna talk like that
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
'Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like
To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you
Yeah, to my babies
Stay strong, daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let anyone tell you you ain't beautiful
Still love me? Take This (Cocks gun twice)
You ready? One, two, three! (gun fires twice)
Chorus
The more you, put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me? I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
More that you slap me, more that it turns me on
Cause you love me and I love you more
It's sick but who could ever predict
We be doing the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us it's lust
Cause neither one of us trust each other
So we fuck 'till we bust 'till we cuss each other
Out, we know what it's about SHOUT
'Till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fistfight 'till we turn this mother out
And apologize after laughter pain
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm laying here with you
There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do
Chorus
Cause I hate you do you hate me?
Good cause you're so fucking beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut but I'm equal I'm a mutt we're both people
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
Cause one of us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof till they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me cause any chick could say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' Yeah I would
Cause the sex is too damn good
If I ran who would I run to? It would be this soften womb
So its off and on usually more off then on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope the only reason that I cope is cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why
Chorus
I can never understand it that's why I don't try
From junior high untill we both die
You silly hoe why must we try is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goats Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs untill the other begs
We're lying to ourselves that's the beauty of it yea
Cause we truly love each other that's why we're always fighting
All we do is shove each other every other fucking night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change
It's pent up rage we've both had
We both feel like we been out staged by someone else
We've both been someone else's
someone else's problems neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzel don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time
On every song every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoop-la all the whoopty-woo
What you put me through fucking whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of
If this is true love you wouldn't do what
You did last time you wouldn't screw up
This time cause this time girl I'm telling you what
You do it again I'm fucking you up
No matter what you say
Or what you do
I'm a hunt you down 'till I find you
No matter where you run
I'll be right there right behind you
In your nightmare
So I bought you some flowers
And the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
So when you hate me you goin' hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me whore
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady, it's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time, I'm sorry, I've been away so long
My name is Shady, I never meant to leave you
You see that chick in the gym checkin' me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll reroute, maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah, open Sesame mouth
Down the hatch, had the feelin' you can't match it
A rat-tat-tap on your door with the damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tackin' a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like 40 some Xanax's
Shortly come back, I'm tryin to score me some lap dances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so baby, pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 44D and 40's with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back atcha
Well, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do was to just say hello
And are you menstruatin', baby? My lil' friend's waitin' to say hello
The way your titties are wigglin' and your booty's shakin' like jello
Well I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do was to just say hello
Yeah, my equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man, people gimme 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A 5th of rum and 2 bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn livin' room
Excuse me, hun, but what is your name, Vivienne?
I woke up next to ya naked and err, did we um?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap a jimmy, hun?
I'm lookin' for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense, baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is somethin' I'm tryna keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's, I'm fiendin' for some
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum
Well, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello
Do ya happen to have anythin' on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are opal and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Well, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' that curtain for good
Word, word, word, word, word, word, word
I second that and a third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer gettin' them free, 100 bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's gettin' to be where he lustfully searched the den
Pain is hittin' his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly on the phone tryin' to russle up
Muscle relaxants for his back and a couple of Pax's
Now he's doublin' backwards and he's stumblin' back
Slipped and fell, hit his back bone, heard somethin' go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just bustin' my own chops while I'm bustin' a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back
Well, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello
Do ya happen to have anythin' on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are opal and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm, all I wanted to do is just say hello
That's all I'm sayin'
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady, it's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time, I'm sorry, I've been away so long
My name is Shady, I never meant to leave you
Yeah, it's like startin' over, clean slate, ha
Obie, yo I'm sick
Damn, you straight dog?
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I hadda bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise, from the cleaners
Fucked me good, you should've seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable
French role styling, body like a stallion
Sizing up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be a nigga
Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
Our clothes fell like bishop and juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my john
In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop
Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
The cannon, seen us at my temple when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of his black folks
Being a vinyl stretched, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is going on here?
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated 'cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I ain't really got that shit, fuck
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time
Now I don't wanna hit no women when this chicks got it coming
Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on, begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But whys she shoving me for doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan, now the plot has thickened 'n worse
'Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweating every minute you're in it
Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the menace
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it
So you jet back home, 'cause you gone get that ho
When you see her, you're gonna bend her fucking neck back yo
'Cause you love her, you never would've expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obie's penis
She's so deceiving, shit this ho's a genius, she geed us
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks' be getting drips
Falling victim's to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time
I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches
Fuck em all, get money
Ha, shady records
Wow, Obie Trice
Eminem mother fucker
New millennium shit, yeah
Turn this shit off, turn this shit the fuck off
(Eminem)
This thing right here, its letting all the people knowm
What burnouts talk about. You know, The Chronic...
(Verse 1)
Oo that buds look scandolous,
You hit it too hard you can't handle this,
So you smokin' that thing when you pass it to us,
With a look in your eyes so devious,
You inhale with all you got, suck it down hard til' your seeing dots,
And your body's on the ground but your mind is not,
Cause your livin' la vida smoke-ah
(chorus 1)
Now your high as a kite (kite, kite)
Been tokin' all night (night, night)
All night long (all night long)
Let me hit that bong, baby,
That bong bo-bong bong bong
I like to roll a blunt oo,
And smoke it in a pipe too,
but best of all,
is that bong bo-bong bong bong
(verse 2)
You know you love that Canabis,
So pull up a chair and come smoke with us,
They call me Crisqo I can bake so much,
I like to hot box the two of us,
Pu-puff kids, til' its 4/20,
This stuff ain't cheap, I need more money,
But when I buy that green I get the best they got,
Cause I'm livin' la vida smoke-ah
(Chorus 2)
Now I'm high as kite (kite, kite)
I been tokin' all night (night, night)
All night long (all night long)
Let me hit that bong, baby,
That bong bo-bong bong bong,
I like to roll a blunt oo,
And smoke it in a pipe too,
but best of all,
is that bong bo-bong bong bong.
(Inhales, coughs)
Once you call my name out things will never be the same....
They should have never let us get off foot in this game...
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode
And have another episode where I let it go as far as
The one with Benzino did I'm waitin for that next beef, 
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas, 
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fuckin pole vault with
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated 
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game
Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing,
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
They all tryin to get that stamp
They after that Shady - Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin jackpot for me 
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery 
And a damn slot machine at the same time as eachother
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with eachother 
In time we discovered that we have more in common 
Then we thought with eachother
Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin god doesn't love us
Two odd motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in ??
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wond-erin
Even if I'm under the gun 
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual
Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all 
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dogg was hollerin
'Fuck Compton'
I was whilin', freestylin back when they was still makin Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet 
That tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky-Ticky-Toc-Ticky-Ticky-Toc
Still with the Diggy-Diggy-Doc-Diggy-Diggy-Doc
And you don't stop
 
 
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
Till one night he snuck in and said
"We're goin' out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed"
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
"After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest", the next day my mother said
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid"
"The bastard won't even eat nothin', he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead"
"Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck"
"I bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I'll bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object?"
"Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head"
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
Did you get him? Naw the fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything 'cept his tank top and his trainin' bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady Dog
Man, that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he, dog?
Shady Dog, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
Don't you know what feltch means? Yeah, well then tell me
Would you rather get feltched or do the feltchin'?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belchin'
Burp, belch and go back for a second helpin'
Can you dig what I'm sayin', man, could you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelpin'
Shady, what the fuck you sayin'? I don't know help me
What the fuck's happenin'? I think I'm fuckin' meltin'
"Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well being"
No Dad, I said, no, I don't need no help peein'
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like 'Nightmare on Elm Street'
But it was X and they called it 'Pubic Hair on Chelsea'
Well, this one's called 'Ass Rape' and we're shootin' the jail scene
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Drezy'll
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit I layed to tape 'fore they erase me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm going too fast cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushin' up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I the heavenly gates, I'd be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embrace me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom, far as she raised me
In a neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today
See regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryin' to strip me of my credibility or make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been savin'
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me
'Cause I've been patiently waitin' for the day
That we finally meet, in the same place to see
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MC's I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MC's I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon', say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit, graze it
Your peace talk, save it, your shit sounds, dated
You're over-rated, I'm obli-gated
To study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss shit
To be specific I go ballistic, it's hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it bag it or chop it
It get you high over and over but you gotta cop it
When it's hot it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MC's I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MC's I eat up
Oh, it's never enough

[Verse 1 - Eminem] 
It's like a throne that he dont even own 
He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around 
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing 
He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry 
He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport 
Runnin suckaz with the competition round the court 
He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it 
And you cant love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it 
You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short 
But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it 
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys 
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it

He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate 
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate 
Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate 
And he hops in a 100 thousands with a Nigga's gate 
House with just a bigger gate , houndin him was a big mistake 
He wont surrender he'd rather give up a rib to break 
Cuz he horrendous when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand 
So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan 
Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name 
When you discuss him the illest playa that's in the game 
And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them 
G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them

I can give you somethin' you can talk about 
I can turn this smile upside down 
You ain't no G-Unit fuckin' clown 
I can take your girl until I turn her out 
The bootey layed all out 
I can give you fuckin' somethin' to be mad about 
And buy her rings and I back out 
With my DNA all in her mouth.
Here's the story, of a little boy.
Growin' up in a suburban home,
Trying to cope with everyday life,
Who lives in a little house,
That was built, in the middle of the street.
"Hey, Mom!
Tupac's on the juke box,
so what he shot two cops,
and raped a little girl,
while two dudes watched,"
"Nuh-uh! They were tryin' to frame him,
You wouldn't have Two Pack Shaker,"
"No! That ain't how you say his name, mum!
You're so lame,
Don't you know anything?"
"Yeah!
I know that you'll probably go,
and join in a gang,"
"Yeah, right. Im out
Where's my fuckin' walkman at?"
"Stop cussin' at me!"
"Shut up, bitch!"
"And quit talking black."
Well,
Slammed the door and I'm out,
Now, what?
It's probably warm in the house.
Fuck, I forgot my jacket,
forgot it was winter.
I'm gettin' thinner,
I'm hungry.
Is Mom cookin' dinner?
"Mom!
Let me back in!
I forgot my coat.
Mom, come on, I'm not playin',
It's cold!
Alright, sorry.
I need a jacket,
Mom, look,
My Tupac tape,
I just cracked it,
Ma, please let me back in,
It is Two Pack Shaker,
I just asked him."
I'm freezin', (achoo)
I'm sneezin',
I'm breathin' too much cold air,
I'm wheezin',
"I ain't did nothin',
I didn't say "I'm leavin',"
I said "I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin',""
(scissors cutting)
"Alright, here.
Take your damn coat and leave,"
"Finaly!,
Mom! You cut off the sleaves!"
(Chorus 4x)
Our house,
In the middle of the street.
One, two, three,
My teacher's two faced,
She went to lower my school grades,
Since Last Tuesday,
I had a toothache,
from kool-aid,
So Mom kicked me out, (get out)
And, all i had in my suitcase,
Was one shoelace,
A tube sock,
and a tube of toothpaste,
Sometimes,
It was cool,
"cause I could go to a friend's,
Crash there,
Fool around and just skip school.
But other times,
I'd rather just be home,
In my own room alone,
BEAT my shit and nobody would know,
My little brother sucked on a bottle,
'Til he was six,
So I'd hide it inside the couch,
And say "I don't know where it is,"
But as soon as Mom found it,
I would either be grounded,
or kicked out the house,
a thousand weeks,.
and still countin',
Even when I was underage,
Mom was tellin' cops,
I was tryin' to run away,
I told her,
"Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay,"
Please, Mom, Please, Mom, Please, Mom,
I wanna stay, (let me stay)
(Chorus 4x)
My brother's incoherint,
Mom's a single parent,
Who ain't carin',
Starin' through me,
Like I'm transparent,
Made it clear,
That I was just there,
to run an errands,
Told her friends,
I was a son from her last marriage,
Sent me up to the little corner store,
with a little note,
"Please, sell my step-son,
Some cigarettes so I can smoke,"
One time,
I tried to fake sick,
To get attention,
Back-fired,
Mom, sent me to school,
With a vengence,
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me,
I go to class,
and every teacher's always laughin' at me,
And Mom says white rappers are laughed at.
Not only that,
She heard me upstairs,
I can't rap,
and I'm stupid,
I never make an average,
of a B+,
I need to sit on my ass and sue people,
Like she does,
One time, I got food poison,
From a hot dog,
Mom sued and got $2,000,
From Ballpark,
"Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?"
"I don't think so.
Now keep an eye on your brother,
I'm goin' to bingo."
"But, Mom. You said you were broke."
"Who said?
You got your ears messed up,
from that damn rap music."
(Chorus Fades Out)
I need you to pray for me
And I need you to care for me
And I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been
Flows, bones, crushing it's nothing
I come up with something
Come through your strip, fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinning
Haters hate that I'm winnning
Man I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fitting to catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot
No, I ain't stopping till my clip is empty
I'm simply not that nigga you should try your luck with
Fuck with, hollow-tip shells struck with your bones broke
Gun smoking, still locing, what nigga
Lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
I cross my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand, the consequences of man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas
'Cause they fronting 20 years
Of watching my mama's tears
Got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bomg 'cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me bury
Balled in the dirt, from shots flurry
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that hummer
'Cause I'mma stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gon' call my number
Under, my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching
What I'm clutching, to give you more then a concussion
End of discussion, my blood is colder, so I'm bolder
Hennesy and soda, hood on my my shoulder
Looking in the mirror, I see a soldier
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games, till they shoot 'em up bang
Then you see ya brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bully my way in this game, man I'm done playing
Man I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying any of these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'mma back down, like a goddamn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me
Not Marshall, you wanna see Marshall?
I'll show you Marshall, I try to show you art
Put you just pick it apart, so I see I have to start
Showing you fucken old farts a whole other side
I wanted to not show you, so you know you're not dealing with
Some fucken marshmallow, little soft yellow
Punk pussy, who's heart's jello, 'cause
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
